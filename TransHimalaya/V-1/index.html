<p class="center chap">PREFACE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> the first place I desire to pay homage to the memory of
my patron, King Oskar of Sweden, by a few words of
gratitude. The late King showed as warm and intelligent
an interest in my plan for a new expedition as he had on
former occasions, and assisted in the fulfilment of my
project with much increased liberality.</p>

<p>I estimated the cost of the journey at 80,000 kronor
(about £4400), and this sum was subscribed within a week
by my old friend Emmanuel Nobel, and my patrons,
Frederik Löwenadler, Oscar Ekman, Robert Dickson,
William Olsson, and Henry Ruffer, banker in London.
I cannot adequately express my thanks to these gentlemen.
In consequence of the political difficulties I encountered in
India, which forced me to make wide detours, the expenses
were increased by about 50,000 kronor (£2800), but this
sum I was able to draw from my own resources.</p>

<p>As on former occasions, I have this time also to thank
Dr. Nils Ekholm for his great kindness in working out
the absolute heights. The three lithographic maps have
been compiled from my original sheets with painstaking
care by Lieutenant C. J. Otto Kjellström, who devoted all
his furlough to this troublesome work. The astronomical
points, nearly one hundred, have been calculated by the
Assistant Roth of the Stockholm Observatory; a few
points, which appeared doubtful, were omitted in drawing
the route on the map, which is based on points previously
determined. The map illustrating my narrative in the
<i>Geographical Journal</i>, April 1909, I drew roughly from
memory without consulting the original sheets, for I had
no time to spare; the errors which naturally crept in have
been corrected on the new maps, but I wish to state here
the cause of the discrepancy. The final maps, which I
hope to publish in a voluminous scientific work, will be
distinguished by still greater accuracy and detail.</p>

<p>I claim not the slightest artistic merit for my drawings,
and my water-colours are extremely defective both in
drawing and colouring. One of the pictures, the lama
opening the door of the mausoleum, I left unfinished in my
haste; it has been thrown in with the others, with the
wall-paintings and shading incomplete. To criticize these
slight attempts as works of art would be like wasting
gunpowder on dead crows. For the sake of variety
several illustrations have been drawn by the British artists
De Haenen and T. Macfarlane, but it must not be assumed
that these are fanciful productions. Every one of them is
based on outline drawings by myself, a number of photographs,
and a full description of the scene. De Haenen&rsquo;s
illustrations appeared in the London <i>Graphic</i>, and were
ordered when I was still in India. Macfarlane&rsquo;s drawings
were executed this summer, and I was able to inspect his
designs and approve of them before they were worked up.</p>

<p>As to the text, I have endeavoured to depict the events
of the journey as far as the limited space permitted, but I
have also imprudently allowed myself to touch on subjects
with which I am not at all familiar&mdash;I allude in particular
to Lamaism. It has been unfortunate that I had to write
the whole book in 107 days, during which many hours were
taken up with work connected with the maps and illustrations
and by an extensive correspondence with foreign
publishers, especially Albert Brockhaus of Leipzig, who
never wearied in giving me excellent advice. The whole
work has been hurried, and the book from beginning to
end is like a vessel which ventures out into the ocean of
the world&rsquo;s tumult and of criticism with many leaks and
cracks.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to my father, who made a clean
copy from my illegible manuscript; and to my mother, who
has saved me from many mistakes. Dr. Carl Forstrand
has revised both the manuscript and the proof-sheets, and
has compiled the Swedish index.</p>

<p class="pt2">&nbsp;</p>

<hr />

<p class="pt2">The seven and thirty Asiatics who followed me faithfully
through Tibet, and contributed in no small degree to the
successful issue and results of the expedition, have had the
honour of receiving from His Majesty the King of Sweden
gold and silver medals bearing the portrait of the King, a
crown, and an inscription. I humbly beg His Majesty to
accept my warmest and most sincere thanks for his great
generosity.</p>

<p>The book is dedicated to Lord Minto, as a slight testimony
of my gratitude for all his kindness and hospitality.
It had been Lord Minto&rsquo;s intention to further my plans
as Lord Curzon would have done if he had still been
Viceroy of India, but political considerations prevented him.
When, however, I was actually in Tibet, the Viceroy was
free to use his influence with the Tashi Lama, and the
consequence was that many doors in the forbidden land,
formerly tightly closed, were opened to me.</p>

<p>Dear reminiscences of India hovered about my lonesome
years in dreary Tibet like the pleasant rustling of
palm leaves. It will suffice to mention men like Lord
Kitchener, in whose house I spent a week never to be
forgotten; Colonel Dunlop Smith, who took charge of my
notes and maps and sent them home, and also forwarded a
whole caravan of necessaries to Gartok; Younghusband,
Patterson, Ryder, Rawling, and many others. And, lastly,
Colonel Longe, Surveyor-General, and Colonel Burrard, of
the Survey of India, who, with the greatest kindness, had
my 900 map-sheets of Tibet photographed, and stored the
negatives among their records in case the originals should
be lost, and who, after I had placed my 200 map-sheets of
Persia at the disposal of the Indian Government, had them
worked up in the North-Western Frontier Drawing Office
and combined into a fine map of eleven printed sheets&mdash;a
map which is to be treated as &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; until my
scientific works have appeared.</p>

<p>It is with the greatest pleasure that I avail myself of
this opportunity of expressing my sincere gratitude for all
the innumerable tokens of sympathy and appreciation which
I received in all parts of the United Kingdom, and for
all the honours conferred on me by Societies, and the warm
welcome I met with from the audiences I had the pleasure
of addressing. I shall always cherish a proud and happy
remembrance of the two months which it was my good-fortune
to spend in the British Isles; and the kindness then
showered upon me was the more delightful because it was
extended also to two of my sisters, who accompanied me.</p>

<p>Were I to mention all the ladies and gentlemen to
whom I am especially indebted, I could fill several pages.
But I cannot let this book go forth through the English-speaking
world without expressing my sincere gratitude
to Lord Curzon for the great and encouraging interest he
has always taken in myself and my journeys; to Lord
Morley for the brilliant speech he delivered after my first
lecture&mdash;the most graceful compliment ever paid me, as well
as for many other marks of kindness and sympathy shown
to me by the Secretary of State for India; to the Swedish
Minister in London, Count Herman Wrangel, for all the
valuable services he rendered me during and after my
journey; to Major Leonard Darwin and the Council and
Members of the Royal Geographical Society, to whom I
was delighted to return, not as a strange guest, but as an
old friend; to the famous and illustrious Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, where I was overwhelmed with
exceptional honours and boundless hospitality; to the Royal
Scottish Geographical Society, where twice before I had
received a warm reception. Well, when I think of those
charming days in England and Scotland I am inclined to
dwell too long upon them, and I must hasten to a conclusion.
But there is one more name, which I have left
to the last, because it has been very dear to me for many
years, that of Dr. J. Scott Keltie. The general public
will never know what it means to be the Secretary and
mainspring of the Royal Geographical Society, to work
year after year in that important office in Savile Row, to
receive explorers from all corners of the world and satisfy
all their demands, without ever losing patience or ever
hearing a word of thanks. I can conceive from my own
experience how much trouble I have caused Dr. Keltie,
but yet he has always met me with the same amiability
and has always been a constant friend, whether I have
been at home or away for years on long journeys.</p>

<p>Dr. M. A. Stein started and returned from his splendid
journey in Central Asia at the same times as myself. We
crossed different parts of the old continent, but we have
several interests in common, and I am glad to congratulate
Dr. Stein most heartily on his important discoveries and
the brilliant results he has brought back.</p>

<p>It is my intention to collect in a third volume all the
material for which there is no room in <i>Trans-Himalaya</i>.
For instance, I have been obliged to omit a description of
the march northwards from the source of the Indus and
of the journey over the Trans-Himalaya to Gartok, as well
as of the road from Gartok to Ladak, and the very
interesting route from the Nganglaring-tso to Simla. I
have also had to postpone the description of several
monasteries to a later opportunity. In this future book I
will also record my recollections of beautiful, charming
Japan, where I gained so many friends, and of Korea,
Manchuria, and Port Arthur. The manuscript of this
later volume is already finished, and I long for the opportunity
of publicly thanking the Japanese, as well as our
representative in Japan and China, the Minister Extraordinary,
Wallenberg, for all the delightful hospitality and
all the honours showered down on me in the Land of the
Rising Sun.</p>

<p>Lastly, the appetite of young people for adventures
will be satisfied in an especial work.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to announce at the eleventh hour
that the Madrassi Manuel, who in Chapter IX. was reported
lost, has at length been found again.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must say a few words of thanks to my
publishers, and first of all to Herre K. O. Bonnier of
Stockholm, for his valuable co-operation and the elegant
form in which he has produced my book, and then to
the firm of F. A. Brockhaus, Leipzig; the &ldquo;Elsevier&rdquo;

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> the spring of the year 1905 my mind was much
occupied with thoughts of a new journey to Tibet. Three
years had passed since my return to my own country; my
study began to be too small for me; at eventide, when
all around was quiet, I seemed to hear in the sough of the
wind a voice admonishing me to &ldquo;come back again to
the silence of the wilderness&rdquo;; and when I awoke in
the morning I involuntarily listened for caravan bells
outside. So the time passed till my plans were ripened
and my fate was soon decided; I must return to the
freedom of the desert and hie away to the broad plains
between the snow-clad mountains of Tibet. Not to listen
to this secret voice when it speaks strongly and clearly
means deterioration and ruin; one must resign oneself to
the guidance of this invisible hand, have faith in its divine
origin and in oneself, and submit to the gnawing pain
which another departure from home, for so long a time and
with the future uncertain, brings with it.</p>

<p>In the concluding lines of my scientific work on the
results of my former journey (<i>Scientific Results</i>) I spoke of
the impossibility of giving a complete description of the
internal structure of Tibet, its mountains and valleys, its
rivers and lakes, while so large a part of the country was
still quite unknown. &ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; I said
(vol. iv. p. 608), &ldquo;I prefer to postpone the completion of
such a monograph till my return from the journey on which
I am about to start.&rdquo; Instead of losing myself in conjectures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
or arriving at confused results owing to lack of
material, I would rather see with my own eyes the unknown
districts in the midst of northern Tibet, and, above all,
visit the extensive areas of entirely unexplored country
which stretches to the north of the upper Brahmaputra
and has not been traversed by Europeans or Indian
pundits. Thus much was <i>à priori</i> certain, that this
region presented the grandest problems which remained
still unsolved in the physical geography of Asia. There
must exist one or more mountain systems running parallel
with the Himalayas and the Karakorum range; there
must be found peaks and ridges on which the eye of the
explorer had never lighted; turquoise-blue salt lakes in
valleys and hollows reflect the restless passage of the
monsoon clouds north-eastwards, and from their southern
margins voluminous rivers must flow down, sometimes
turbulent, sometimes smooth. There, no doubt, were
nomad tribes, who left their winter pastures in spring, and
during the summer wandered about on the higher plains
when the new grass had sprung up from the poor soil.
But whether a settled population dwelt there, whether
there were monasteries, where a lama, punctual as the
sun, gave the daily summons to prayer from the roof by
blowing through a shell,&mdash;that no one knew. Tibetan
literature, old and recent, was searched in vain for
information; nothing could be found but fanciful conjectures
about the existence of a mighty chain, which
were of no value as they did not accord with the reality
and were not based on any actual facts. On the other
hand, a few travellers had skirted the unknown country
on the north and south, east and west, myself among the
number. Looking at a map, which shows the routes of
travellers in Tibet, one might almost suppose that we
had purposely avoided the great white patch bearing on
the recently published English map only the word
&ldquo;Unexplored.&rdquo; Hence it might be concluded that it
would be no easy feat to cross this tract, or otherwise
some one would ere now have strayed into it. In my
book <i>Central Asia and Tibet</i> I have fully described the
desperate attempts I made in the autumn and winter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
1901 to advance southwards from my route between the
Zilling-tso and the Pangong-tso. One of my aims was
to find an opportunity of visiting one or more of the great
lakes in Central Tibet which the Indian pundit, Nain
Sing, discovered in 1874, and which since then had
never been seen except by the natives. During my
former journey I had dreamt of discovering the source
of the Indus, but it was not then my good fortune to
reach it. This mysterious spot had never been inserted
in its proper place on the map of Asia&mdash;but it must
exist somewhere. Since the day when the great Macedonian
Alexander (in the year 326 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) crossed the mighty
stream with his victorious host, the question of the situation
of this spot has always stood in the order of the
day of geographical exploration.</p>

<p>It was both impossible and unnecessary to draw up
beforehand a complete plan of a journey of which the
course and conclusion were more than usually uncertain,
and depended on circumstances quite beyond my control.
I did, indeed, draw on a map of Tibet the probable route
of my journey, that my parents and sisters might know
roughly whereabouts I should be. If this map be compared
with my actual route it will be seen that in both
cases the districts visited are the same, but the course
and details are totally different.</p>

<p>In the meantime I wrote to Lord Curzon, then
Viceroy of India, informed him of my plan, and begged
for all the assistance that seemed to me necessary for a
successful journey in disturbed Tibet, so lately in a state
of war.</p>

<p>Soon after I received the following letter, which I reproduce
here with the consent of the writer:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="mr pt2"><span class="sc">Viceregal Lodge, Simla</span>,&emsp;</p>

<p class="mr"><i>July 6, 1905</i>.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Dr. Hedin</span>&mdash;I am very glad that you propose to
act upon my advice, and to make one more big Central Asian
journey before you desist from your wonderful travels.</p>

<p>I shall be proud to render you what assistance lies in my power
while I still remain in India, and only regret that long before your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
great expedition is over I shall have left these shores. For it is
my intention to depart in April 1906.</p>

<p>Now as regards your plan. I gather that you will not be in
India before next spring, when perhaps I may still see you. I will
arrange to have a good native surveyor ready to accompany you,
and I will further have a man instructed in astronomical observations
and in meteorological recording&mdash;so as to be available for
you at the same time.</p>

<p>I cannot say what the attitude of the Tibetan Government will
be at the time that you reach India. But if they continue friendly,
we will of course endeavour to secure for you the requisite permits
and protections.</p>

<p>Assuring you that it will give me the greatest pleasure in any
way to further your plans,&mdash;I am yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="mr"><span class="sc">Curzon</span>.&emsp;</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2">It may easily be conceived how important this active
protection and help on the part of the Viceroy was to
me. I was especially pleased that I was allowed to take
with me native topographers experienced in survey work,
for with their co-operation the maps to be compiled would
be far more valuable, while, released from this complicated
work which takes up so much time, I could devote myself
entirely to researches in physical geography.</p>

<p>With this kind letter at starting I commenced my fifth
journey to Asia. Lord Curzon had, indeed, when I
reached India, already left his post, and a new Government
was shortly to take the helm in England with Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman as premier. But Lord Curzon&rsquo;s
promises were the words of a Cæsar, and I had not the
slightest doubt that a Liberal Government would respect them.</p>

<p>On October 16, 1905, the same day on which I had
started twelve years before on my journey through Asia,
I again left my dear old home in Stockholm. This time
it seemed far more uncertain whether I should see all my
dear ones again; sometime or other the chain that binds
us must be broken. Would it be granted me to find once
more my home unchanged?</p>

<p>I travelled viâ Constantinople and the Black Sea,
through Turkish Armenia, across Persia to Seistan, and
through the deserts of Baluchistan to Nushki, where I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
reached the most western offshoot of the Indian railway
system. After the dust and heat of Baluchistan, Quetta
seemed to me a fine fresh oasis. I left this town on
May 20, 1906, descended in four hours from a height of
5500 feet to a country lying only 300 feet above sea-level,
and found in Sibi a temperature of 100° F. in the evening.
Next day I passed along the Indus and Sutlej through
Samasata and Batinda to Ambala, and I was now, in the
hottest part of the year, the only European in the train.
The temperature rose to 107°, the height I had shortly
before recorded in Baluchistan, but it was much more
endurable in the shady carriage, which was protected by
a roof and hanging screens from the direct heat of the
sun; it was well, however, to avoid touching the outside
of the carriage, for it was burning hot. Two window
openings are covered with a tissue of root-fibres which
are automatically kept moist, and a wind-catcher sends a
draught into the carriage through the wet matting. At a
window like this the temperature even at noon was only
81½°, and therefore I had nothing to complain of. At
some stations there are excellent restaurants, and natives
travelling on the train sell on the way lemonade and ice
as clear as glass.</p>

<p>Nevertheless in India&rsquo;s sultry dried-up plains one longs
for the mountains with their pure cool air. From Kalka
a small narrow-gauge railway carries one in 6½ hours
to a height of 7080 feet, and one finds oneself in Simla,
the summer residence of the Viceroy and the headquarters
of the Indian Army. The road is one of the most
charming and magnificent in the world. The little railway
climbs up the steep flanks in the boldest curves, descends
the slopes into deep and narrow ravines, passes along
steep mountain spurs, where the train seems as though
it would plunge into space from the extreme point; then
the train crosses bridges which groan and tremble under
its weight, enters pitch-dark tunnels, and again emerges
into the blinding sunshine. Now we run along a valley,
catching a glimpse of the bottom far below us, then mount
upwards to a ridge affording an extensive view on both
sides, then again traverse a steep slope where several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
sections of the marvellously winding line can be seen
below. The scene changes every other minute, new
contours and landscapes present themselves, new points
of view and lights and shades follow one another, and
keep the attention of the traveller on the stretch. There
are 102 tunnels on the route, most of them quite short,
but the longest has a length of three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<p>We pass through one zone of vegetation after another.
The flora of the plain is left far behind; now the eye
notices new forms in new zones&mdash;forms characteristic of the
various heights of the southern slopes of the Himalayas&mdash;and
at last appear the dark deodar forests, the royal
Himalayan cedars, with their luxuriant green foliage,
amidst which are embedded the houses of Simla like
swallows&rsquo; nests. How fascinating is this sight, but how
much more imposing as a symbol of the power of the
British Empire! Here the eagle has its eyry, and from
its point of vantage casts its keen eyes over the plains of
India. Here converge innumerable telegraph wires from
all the corners and extremities of the British Empire, and
from this centre numerous orders and instructions are
daily despatched &ldquo;On His Majesty&rsquo;s Service only&rdquo;; here
the administration is carried on and the army controlled,
and a host of maharajas are entangled in the meshes like
the prey in the nest of a spider.</p>

<p>I approached Simla with some anxiety. Since Lord
Curzon&rsquo;s letter I had heard nothing more from the
authorities in India. The singular town on its crescent-shaped
ridge appears larger and larger, details become
clearer and clearer, there remain only a couple of curves
to pass, and then the train rolls into the station at Simla.
Two servants from the Foreign Office, in scarlet liveries,
took possession of my luggage, and I was welcomed in
the Grand Hotel by my old friend Colonel Sir Francis
Younghusband&mdash;we kept Christmas together in Kashgar
in 1890, and he was just as friendly and pleasant as then.
I was his guest at dinner in the United Service Club.
During half the night we revelled in old reminiscences of
the heart of Asia, spoke of the powerful Russian Consul-General,
Petrovski, in Kashgar, of the English expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
to Lhasa, which was led by Younghusband, of life in
Simla and the coming festivities in the summer season&mdash;but
of my prospects my friend did not utter a word! And
I did not ask him; I could believe that if everything had
been plain and straightforward he would have told me
at once. But he was silent as the grave, and I would
not question him, though I was burning with impatience
to learn something or other.</p>

<p>When I went out on to my balcony on the morning
of May 23, I felt like a prisoner awaiting his sentence.
Below me the roofs of Simla glittered in the sunshine,
and I stood on a level with the tops of the cedars; how
delightful it was here far above the heavy sultry air of
the plain. To the north, through a gap in the luxuriant
woods, appeared a scene of incomparable beauty. There
gleamed the nearest ranges of the Himalayas covered
with eternal snow. The crest shone white against the
turquoise-blue sky. The air was so clear that the distance
seemed insignificant; only a few days&rsquo; journey separated
me from these mountains, and behind them lay mysterious
Tibet, the forbidden land, the land of my dreams. Later
on, towards mid-day, the air became hazy and the glorious
view vanished, nor was it again visible during the few
weeks I spent in Simla. It seemed as though a curtain
had fallen between me and Tibet, and as though it had
been vouchsafed to me to see only once from a distance
the mountains over which the road led into the land of
promise.</p>

<p>It was a sad day; at twelve o&rsquo;clock I was to hear my
sentence. Younghusband came for me and we went
together to the Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s Office. Sir Louis
Dane received me with great amiability, and we talked
of Persia and the trade route between India and Seistan.
Suddenly he became silent, and then said after a pause:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better you should know at once; the Government
in London refuses you permission to pass into Tibet
across the Indian frontier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sad news! But why is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I do not know; probably because the present
Government wishes to avoid everything which may give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
rise to friction on the frontier; the granting of your request
throws responsibility on us should anything happen
to you. Yes, it is a pity. What do you think of doing
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had had any suspicion of this in Teheran, I would
have taken my way through Russian Asia, for I have
never met with any difficulties from the Russians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we have done out here all we could to forward
your plans. The three native surveyors Lord Curzon
promised you have been trained for six months, and hold
themselves in readiness at Dehra Dun. But probably
this too will be countermanded from London. Still, we
have not yet given up all hope, and we expect the final
answer on June 3.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To have to wait eleven days for the final decision was
unbearable. Perhaps a personal application might have
a favourable effect. I therefore sent the following telegram
to the English Prime Minister:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The friendly words, in which your Excellence referred two
years ago in Parliament to my journey and my book, encourage
me to apply direct to you, and to beg you in the interests of
geographical science to grant me the permission of your Government
to pass into Tibet by way of Simla and Gartok. I propose
to explore the region, mostly uninhabited, to the north of the
Tsangpo, and the lakes lying in it, and then to return to India.
I am thoroughly acquainted with the present political relations
between India and Tibet, and as I have held peaceful intercourse
with Asiatics since my twenty-first year, I shall also this time
behave with circumspection, follow the instructions I am given,
and consider it a point of honour to avoid all disputes on the
frontier.</p>
</div>

<p>And now we waited again; the days passed, my three
native assistants held themselves ready in Dehra Dun for
the journey, the Commander-in-chief, Lord Kitchener,
assured me that he should be pleased to place at my
disposal twenty armed Gurkhas&mdash;only the permission
sought from the Secretary of State for India, Mr. John
Morley, must first arrive; for it was he who held the
keys of the frontier, and on him everything depended.
Lord Minto, the new Viceroy of India (Frontispiece), did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
everything in his power. He wrote long complete statements
of affairs and sent one telegram after another. A
refusal could not discourage him; he always sent off
another despatch beginning with the words: &ldquo;I beg His
Majesty&rsquo;s Ministry to take once more into consideration
that,&rdquo; etc. When the assurance was given from London
that the refusal was not intended for me personally, but
that the same answer had been communicated to several
British officers, Lord Minto in his last telegram begged
that I might be permitted to accompany the British officer
who was to travel to Gartok in summer to inspect the
market there. But the Secretary of State kept immovably
to his resolution, and I received the following reply to my
telegram in a despatch of June 1, 1906, from the Secretary
to the Viceroy:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Prime Minister desires that the following message be
communicated to Sven Hedin: &ldquo;I sincerely regret that I cannot,
for reasons which have doubtless been explained to you by the
Indian Government, grant you the desired assistance for your
journey to and in Tibet. This assistance has also been refused to
the Royal Geographical Society in London, and likewise to British
officers in the service of the Indian Government.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The contents of the last London telegram intimated,
then, that nothing was conceded to me. The Indian
Government and the Viceroy could, of course, do nothing
but obey, as usual, the orders from London. They were
willing to do everything, and displayed the warmest
interest in my plans, but they durst not help me. They
durst not procure me a permit or passport from Lhasa,
they durst not provide me with an escort, indispensable in
the insecure country of Tibet, and I lost the privilege of
taking with me three efficient topographers and assistants
in my scientific observations, from which both sides would
have derived advantage. But this was not all. Should I
fall in with circumstances and cross the frontier with a party
of natives on my own responsibility, the Indian Government
had orders to stop me. Thus Tibet was barred to
me from the side of India, and the English, that is, Mr.
John Morley, closed the country as hermetically as ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
the Tibetans had done. I soon perceived that the
greatest difficulties I had to overcome on this journey
proceeded not from Tibet, its rude climate, its rarefied
air, its huge mountains and its wild inhabitants, but&mdash;from
England! Could I circumvent Mr. John Morley, I should
soon settle with Tibet.</p>

<p>Hope is the last thing one resigns, and so I still hoped
that all would turn out well in the end. Failure spurred
my ambition and stretched my powers to the uttermost
tension. Try to hinder me if you can, I thought; I will
show you that I am more at home in Asia than you. Try
to close this immense Tibet, try to bar all the valleys
which lead from the frontier to the high plateaus, and you
will find that it is quite impossible. I felt quite relieved
when the last peremptory and somewhat curt refusal came
and put an end to all further negotiations. I had a feeling
as though I was suddenly left in solitude and the future
depended on myself alone. My life and my honour for
the next two years were at stake&mdash;of course I never
thought of giving in. I had commenced this fifth journey
with a heavy heart, not with trumpets and flourishes as on
the former expeditions. But now it was all at once
become my pet child. Though I should perish, this
journey should be the grandest event of my life. It was
the object of all my dreams and hopes, it was the subject
of my prayers, and I longed with all my soul for the hour
when the first caravan should be ready&mdash;and then every
day would be a full chord in a song of victory.</p>

<p>I do not venture to pass an opinion on the policy which
then piled up in my way obstacles apparently insurmountable.
It was at any rate prudent. For the future it will
be necessary. If I had gone under British protection and
accompanied by British subjects and then been killed, probably
a costly punitive expedition must have been sent
out to make an example; whether I were a Swede or an
Englishman would have made no difference in this case.
The view the English Secretary of State took of the matter
is shown in his answer to Lord Percy&rsquo;s question a month
after I had received my answer: &ldquo;Sven Hedin has been
refused permission to penetrate into Tibet for political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
reasons, in accordance with which even British subjects are
not allowed to visit that country. The Indian Government
favours the expeditions of experienced explorers, but the
Imperial Government has decided otherwise, and considers
it advisable to continue the isolation of Tibet which the
late Government so carefully maintained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this time I received many proofs of sympathy
and friendship. I had true friends in India, and they felt
it hard that they could not help me. They would have
done it so gladly. I durst not ask them for anything lest
I should place them in an awkward, troublesome position.
Sir Louis Dane had informed me that if my petition were
granted I should have to sign a bond, but what this
would have contained I have never found out. Perhaps it
dealt with some kind of responsibility for the men who
accompanied me, or a promise not to visit certain districts,
and a pledge to place the results of my journey at the
disposal of the Indian Government&mdash;I know not. But
now I was absolved from all obligations; freedom is after
all the best, and he is the strongest who stands alone.
Still, it would be exaggeration to say that I had then any
great affection for the name of Mr. John Morley. How
could I foresee that I should one day reckon him among
my best friends, and think of him with warm respect and
admiration?</p>

<p>After my first visit to the Foreign Office, Younghusband
(Illustration 2) conducted me to the Viceregal Palace, to
enter my name in the visiting list of Lord and Lady Minto.
Younghusband is a gallant man, a type of the noblest that
a people can produce. He was more annoyed than myself
at the refusal of the Government; but he had in this
connection a far more bitter experience&mdash;his expedition to
Lhasa, which ought to have thrown open Tibet to scientific
exploration, had been in vain. He took me on the way
to Lord Minto&rsquo;s private secretary, Colonel J. R. Dunlop
Smith (Illustration 3), in whom I found a friend for life.
He is one of the finest, noblest, most generous, and learned
men that I have ever met. He is well educated in
many subjects, and has a thorough knowledge of India,
for he has lived there four-and-twenty years. When we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
see such men in the most responsible posts, we can well
conceive that the ruling race will weather many a violent
storm, should they arise, among the three hundred millions
of India.</p>

<p>My life at this time abounded in contrasts. How
little did my sojourn at Simla resemble the years of solitude
and silence that awaited me beyond the mountains
veiled in dark masses of cloud! I cannot resist recalling
some reminiscences of these extraordinarily delightful
days.</p>

<p>Go with me to the first State dinner on May 24, 1906.
Along the walls of the great drawing-room in the Viceregal
Palace are assembled some hundred guests&mdash;all in full dress,
in grand uniforms of various colours, and glittering with
orders. One of them is taller than the rest by a whole
head; he holds himself very upright, and seems cool-headed,
energetic, and calm; he speaks to no one, but
examines those about him with penetrating, bright bluish-grey
eyes. His features are heavy, but interesting, serious,
impassive, and tanned; one sees that he has had much
experience and is a soldier who has stood fire. His uniform
is scarlet, and a whole fortune in diamonds sparkles on his
left breast. He bears a world-renowned, an imperishable
name: Lord Kitchener of Khartum, the conqueror of
Africa and Commander-in-chief of the Indian Army.</p>

<p>A gentleman comes up to me and asks if I remember
our having sat together at a banquet of Lord Curzon&rsquo;s.
The Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab is also one of my
old acquaintances, and Sir Louis Dane introduces me
right and left. A herald enters the room and announces
the approach of the Viceroy, and Lord Minto, accompanied
by his staff, makes the round of the room, greeting each one
of his guests, myself only with the words, &ldquo;Welcome
to Simla.&rdquo; The melancholy tone of the words did not escape
me; he knew well that I did not feel as welcome as
he and I should have wished. To the sound of music we
move to the dining-room, are regaled with choice French
dishes, eat off silver plate, and then rise again to take part
in the levée, at which five hundred gentlemen are presented
to the Viceroy, who stands at the steps of the throne.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
Their names are called out one by one as they pass rapidly
in front of the throne. Each one halts and turns to the Viceroy,
who returns his deep reverence: he bowed this evening
nine hundred times! When Indian princes or Afghan
ambassadors pass before him, he does not bow, but lays
his hand on the hilt of his guest&rsquo;s sword as a sign of
friendship and peace.</p>

<p>Next day I was invited to transfer my quarters to the
palace (Illustration 4), and henceforth I was the guest of
Lord and Lady Minto. The time I spent with them I shall
never forget, and these weeks seem to me now like a dream
or a fairy tale. Lord Minto is an ideal British gentleman,
an aristocrat of the noblest race, and yet simple and modest.
In India he soon became popular owing to his affability
and kindness, and he does not think he occupies so high a
position that he cannot speak a friendly word to any man
out of the numerous tribes of the immense Empire committed
to his rule. Lord Minto formerly served in India,
and took part in the campaign against Afghanistan; after
various experiences in three continents he was appointed
Governor-General of Canada. In 1904 he returned to
his estate of Minto in Scotland, intending to spend the
remainder of his life there; then the King of England and
Emperor of India invested him with the office of Viceroy
and Governor-General of India. He is not the first Earl
of Minto who has held this post, for his great-grandfather
was Governor-General of the British possessions in the
Indian peninsula a hundred years ago. Then one had to
sail round the Cape of Good Hope in order to reach
the country of the Hindus, a long, troublesome voyage.
Therefore the first Lord Minto left his family at home.
The letters exchanged between himself and his wife are
still extant, and display an affection and faithfulness quite
ideal. When his period of service in India had at length
expired, he embarked on a vessel which carried him over the
long way to his native land, and he hurried with the first
coach straight to Minto. There his wife expected him;
she looked along the road with longing eyes; the appointed
time had long passed, and no carriage could be
seen. At length a rider appeared in a cloud of dust, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
brought the news that Lord Minto had died only one post
stage from his house. A small label on the packet of
letters bears the words &ldquo;Poor fools.&rdquo; They were written by
the first Lady Minto.</p>

<p>But now a new Minto family has blossomed into life.
Comfort, simplicity, and happiness prevail in this charming
home, where every member contributes to the beauty of
the whole. A viceroy is always overwhelmed with work
for the welfare of India, but Lord Minto preserved an
unalterable composure, and devoted several hours daily to
his family. We met at meals; some guests were usually
invited to lunch, but at dinner we were frequently alone,
and then the time passed most agreeably. Then Lady
Minto told of her sojourn in Canada, where she travelled
116,000 miles by rail and steamer, accompanied her husband
on his official tours and on sporting expeditions, shot
foaming rapids in a canoe, and took part in dangerous
excursions in Klondike. We looked over her diaries
of that time; they consisted of thick volumes full of
photographs, maps, cuttings, and autographs, and were
interspersed with views and descriptions of singular
interest. And yet the diary that Lady Minto had kept
since her arrival in India was still more remarkable and
attractive, for it was set in Oriental splendour and the
pomp and gorgeousness of Eastern lands, was filled with
maharajas bedecked with jewels, receptions in various
states, processions and parades, elephants in red and gold,
and all the grandeur and brilliancy inseparable from the
court of an Indian viceroy. Three charming young
daughters&mdash;the Ladies Eileen, Ruby, and Violet&mdash;fill this
home with sunshine and cheerfulness, and, with their
mother, are the queens of the balls and brilliant fêtes.
Like their father, they are fond of sport, and ride like
Valkyries.</p>

<p>Is it to be wondered at that a stranger feels happy in
this house, where he is surrounded daily with kindness
and hospitality? My room was over the private apartments
of the Viceroy. On the ground-floor are State
rooms, the large and elegant drawing-rooms, the dining-room,
and the great ball-room decorated in white and gold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
The various rooms and saloons are reached from a large antechamber
adorned with arms and heavy hangings; here
there is a very lively scene during entertainments. An
open gallery, a stone verandah, runs round most of the
ground-floor, where visitors, couriers, <i>chaprassis</i>, and
<i>jamadars</i>, wearing red viceregal uniforms and white turbans,
move to and fro. Behind is the courtyard where carriages,
rickshaws, and riders come and go, while well-kept paths
lead to quiet terraces laid out from Lady Minto&rsquo;s designs.
Behind these terraces begins the forest with promenades
in the shadow of the trees (Illustration 5).</p>

<p>From the great hall in the middle of the house a
staircase leads to the first storey, where the family of the
Viceroy occupy rooms which surpass all the rest in the
tastefulness of their decoration. Two flights up are the
guest-rooms. From an inner gallery you can look down
into the great hall, where the scarlet footmen glide noiselessly
up and down the stairs. Outside my window was a
balcony, where every morning I looked in vain for a
glimpse of the mountains on the borders of Tibet. The
highest official of Peshawar, Sir Harold Deane, with his
wife, and the Maharaja of Idar, were guests in the palace of
the Viceroy for a couple of days. Sir Harold was a man
one never forgets after once meeting him; strong, tall,
manly, and amiable. The half-savage tribes and princes
on the frontier of Afghanistan fear and admire him,
and he is said to manage them with masterly tact. This
meeting was very important to me, for Sir Harold gave
me letters of introduction to the Maharaja of Kashmir and
his private secretary, Daya Kishen Kaul. At my return
to India, Sir Harold was, alas! dead. In him India has
lost one of its best guardians.</p>

<p>The Maharaja of Idar was a striking type of an Indian
Prince: he had a very dark complexion, handsome features,
and an energetic bearing; he dressed for entertainments in
silk, gold, and jewels, and altogether made an appearance
which threw all Europeans quite into the shade. Yet he
was exceedingly popular with them, and always a welcome
guest. He is a great sportsman, a first-rate rider, and an
exceedingly cool-headed hunter. He owes his great popularity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
to the following incident: Once when an English
officer died in the hot season near his palace, there was
difficulty in finding a man to bury the corpse. As every
one else refused, the Maharaja undertook the odious task
himself. Scarcely had he returned to his palace when the
steps were stormed by raving Brahmins, who cried out to
him, with threats, that he had forfeited his rank, must be
ejected from his caste, and was unworthy to have rule over
the state. But he went calmly up to them and said
that he knew only of one caste, that of warriors; then he
ordered them to go away, and they obeyed.</p>

<p>I met many men in Simla whom I shall always count
among my best friends&mdash;Generals Sir Beauchamp Duff and
Hawkes, with their amiable consorts, and Colonel Adam
and his wife, who spoke Russian; he was Lord Minto&rsquo;s
military secretary, and died during my absence; also
Colonel M&rsquo;Swiney and his wife. I was their guest at
Bolaram, near Haidarabad, in 1902, and I had met the
Colonel in the Pamirs in 1895; he, too, has been called
away by death, only a month before he would have received
his expected promotion to the command of the Ambala
brigade. He was an exceptionally excellent and amiable
man. I also made acquaintance with many members of
Younghusband&rsquo;s Lhasa expedition, one of whom, Captain
Cecil Rawling, ardently wished he could get back to Tibet.
We often met and concocted grand plans for a journey
together to Gartok&mdash;hopes which all ended in smoke. The
German Consul-General, Count Quadt, and his charming
wife were also especial friends of mine. Her mother
belonged to the Swedish family of Wirsén, and we conversed
in Swedish. I shall never forget a dinner at their
house. Dunlop Smith and I rode each in a rickshaw along
the long road to Simla, through the town and as far
again on the other side, to Count Quadt&rsquo;s house, which was
the Viceregal residence before Lord Dufferin built the new
palace, the &ldquo;Viceregal Lodge,&rdquo; in the years 1884-1888. The
road was dark, but we had lamps on the shafts; our runners
strained at the carriage like straps, and their naked soles
pattered like wood on the hard earth. We were late; Lord
Kitchener was there already, and every one was waiting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
After dinner the guests were invited to go out into the
compound forming the summit of the hill on which the old
palace is built. The light of the full moon quivered
through the mild intoxicating air, the hills around were
veiled in mist and haze, and from the depths of the valleys
rose the shrill penetrating rattle of grasshoppers. But this
hill, where lively laughter resounded and conversation was
stimulated by the effects of the dinner, seemed to be far
above the rest of the world. Here and there dark firs or
deodars peeped out of the mist with long outstretched arms
like threatening ghosts. The night was quiet, everything
but ourselves and the grasshoppers seemed to have gone
to rest. Such an impression is never effaced. Etiquette
forbade that any one should leave before Lord Kitchener&mdash;he
had to give the signal for breaking up the party; but he
found himself very comfortable here, and we talked in
French with the wife of Colonel Townsend, drawing comparisons
between the matrimonial state and the advantages
of uncontrolled freedom. It was after midnight when the
dictator of the feast rose, and then ladies and their cavaliers
could make for their rickshaws. Silence reigned on the
moonlit hill; only the shrill song of the grasshoppers still
rose to heaven.</p>

<p>A couple of State balls also took place during my stay
in the Viceregal Lodge. Then an endless succession of
rickshaws streams up to the courtyard, winding like a
file of glow-worms up Observatory Hill. One is almost
astonished that there are so many of these small two-wheeled
vehicles in Simla, but only the Viceroy, the Commander-in-chief,
and the Governor of the Punjab are
allowed to use horse carriages, because of the narrowness of
the roads. Then elegant ladies rustle in low dresses of silk,
with agrafes of diamonds in their hair, and pass through
the entrance and hall escorted by cavaliers in full-dress
uniforms. One is frightfully crushed in this flood of people
who have spent hours in adorning themselves so brilliantly,
but the scene is grand and imposing, a <i>non plus ultra</i> of
gala toilets, a kaleidoscope of many colours, of gold and
silver; the red uniforms of the officers stand out sharply
against the light silk dresses of the ladies in white, pink, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
blue. Here and there the jewelled turban of a maharaja
hovers over a sea of European coiffures. Then there is a
sudden silence, a passage is opened through the crowd;
the herald has announced the advent of the Viceroy and
his party, and the band plays &ldquo;God save the King.&rdquo; The
Viceroy and his lady walk slowly through the ranks, saluting
on both sides, and take their seats on the thrones in
the great ball-room; then the first waltz is played. The
illustrious hosts summon first one and then another of their
guests to converse with them; there is a rustling of silk, a
humming and buzzing, shoe-soles glide with a scraping
noise over the floor, and the dance-music hurries on its
victims with irresistible force. The guests flock in small
parties or large groups into the adjoining dining-room, and
there sup at small tables. At length the ranks grow thin,
the hosts retire, the wheels of the last rickshaw rattle over
the sand of the courtyard, the electric lights are extinguished,
and the palace is quiet again.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s residence stands at the end of the
town of Simla, and is called Snowdon. The visitor enters
first a large ante-room, which, with its tasteful arrangement
and decoration, makes rather the impression of a reception
room or a hall of honour bedecked with trophies. A fine
portrait of Gordon Pasha is placed on an easel; opposite
stand busts of Alexander and Cæsar. In the wainscot of
the staircase is inserted the arm of the presidential chair
which Uncle Kruger used in Pretoria, and on the tables,
shelves, and friezes are valuable Chinese vases of the
Kang-hi (1662-1722) and Kien-lung (1736-1795) periods;
for Lord Kitchener is an enthusiastic collector of old
Chinese porcelain, but only the very finest finds favour in
his eyes. But what strikes the stranger most in this unique
hall, and above all attracts his attention, are the trophies
and flags from Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s victories in the Sudan and
South Africa. They hang down from their staves from
an upper gallery, among them the standards of the Mahdi
and the dervishes of Omdurman and Om Debraket, besides
several Boer flags from the Transvaal and the Orange Free
State. In the inner drawing-room we find the same
luxurious decoration with Chinese porcelain vases and rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
ethnographical objects, among which certain Tibetan
temple friezes carved in wood are of great value; they
were brought by Younghusband&rsquo;s Lhasa expedition. On
the tables lie albums of photographs of Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s
numerous tours of inspection in India, and of his journey
through the cold Pamir. At receptions the table is
adorned with costly services in solid gold, gifts of the
English nation to the victor of Africa (Illustration 6).</p>

<p>My time in Simla came to an end; it was useless to
stay any longer after I had received the last decisive
answer from London. On June 9 I took leave of the
Viceroy and his youngest daughter, who were going to
ride to Mashroba and pass the Sunday there. I cannot
describe the leave-taking; it was so warm and hearty.
Lord Minto wished that I might still carry out my intentions,
and he hoped sincerely that we should again meet in
India. I could not on the point of departure express all
the gratitude I felt. He had done all that was in his power
to help me, and had exposed himself to unpleasantnesses
on my account. He had played an important part in my
life&rsquo;s course, and I knew that I had gained in him a lasting
friend. It was a trial to have to say good-bye to him.
He was more grieved than myself that our plans had
miscarried, and for my part I felt that my honour now
demanded that I should do my best.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning Lady Minto and her two eldest
daughters also drove off to Mashroba. I bade them a last
farewell, and thanked them for the boundless hospitality I
had enjoyed in the Viceregal Lodge. The moment of
parting was fortunately short; bitter it certainly was.
Two fine carriages drove up with outriders, and escorted
by native cavalry soldiers in red and gold, carrying lances
in their hands. The ladies, in light bright summer toilets
and hats trimmed with flowers, took their seats&mdash;the group
of ladies of bluest blood, which through centuries and
generations had been ennobled and refined, seemed to
me like a bouquet of flowers themselves. I remained on
the lowest step as long as I could catch a glimpse of the
waving sunshades, but soon the red uniforms of the
soldiers disappeared among the leafy trees of the avenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
which leads down to the main guard, and the romance was
at an end.</p>

<p>When I again entered my room the royal palace seemed
lifeless and desolate, and I had no heart to remain any
longer. I packed my things, hurried into the town and
paid a couple of short farewell calls, made arrangements for
my heavy luggage, and was soon ready to start. On the
13th I went off. The number thirteen plays a rôle of
some importance in this journey: on November 13 I
left Trebizond on the Black Sea; on December 13 I
reached Teheran, the capital of Persia; and on June 13
I left Simla; but I was not superstitious. Younghusband
was the first to welcome me and the last to say good-bye;
I was soon to see him again in Srinagar. Then the train
sped downwards through the 102 tunnels. From a bend
in the road I caught sight of the Viceregal Lodge with its
proud towers and lofty walls, the scene of so many joyful
reminiscences and disappointed hopes.</p>

<p class="center chap2">DEPARTURE FROM SRINAGAR</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Manuel</span> was a singular fellow. He was a Hindu from
Madras, small, thin, and black, spoke good English, and
with his parents had joined the Roman Catholic Church.
He had presented himself at the last moment with a huge
packet of testimonials and declared confidently: &ldquo;If the
gentleman thinks of making a long journey, the gentleman
will want a cook, and I can cook.&rdquo; I took him into my
service without looking at his testimonials (Illustration 15).
He behaved well, was honest, and gave me more satisfaction
than annoyance. The worst he did was to get lost
in Ladak in some mysterious way, and to this hour I have
heard nothing more about him.</p>

<p>In my compartment we sat as close as herrings in a
barrel. The air became hotter and hotter; from the
pleasant coolness of the heights we came again into the
oppressive heat of the Indian plains. Passing Kalka,
Ambala, and Lahore I came to Rawalpindi, where I put up
at a passable hotel. But the room was hot and stuffy, and
the punkah, the great fan hanging down from the ceiling,
was in motion all through the night, but did not prevent
the gnats from paying me importunate visits.</p>

<p>On June 15 a <i>tonga</i> and three <i>ekkas</i> stood before the
hotel; I took my seat in the former, and the baggage was
securely packed on the latter&mdash;and Manuel. The road
runs between fine avenues of trees straight to the foot of
the mountains. The traffic is lively: carts, caravans,
riders, tramps, and beggars. Before us lie slopes of no
great height, and beyond the higher mountains of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
Himalayas. Are they walls erected across my path by
hostile spirits, or do they await my coming?</p>

<p>Beyond Malepur the <i>tonga</i>, drawn by two spirited horses,
passes through the first hills with dark and light tints of
luxuriant green. The road winds up among them, and I
am glad to leave the fiery glow of the plains behind;
certainly the sun is still burning, for the air is clear and the
first forerunners of the cloud masses of the south-west
monsoon have not yet appeared. Thus we pass one stage
after another. We have often to drive slowly, for we meet
long trains of native soldiers in khaki uniforms with forage
and munition waggons, each drawn by two mules&mdash;how
glad I should have been to possess a couple of dozen of
these fine animals! Cool winds blow in our faces and
conifers begin to appear among the foliage trees. We
leave the summer station Murree behind us, and now
the snow-clad mountains at Gulmarg are visible. After
crossing a pass near Murree we ascend again. Beyond
Bandi we reach the right bank of the Jhelam, but the river
lies far below us; the scenery is beautiful, and its grandeur
and magnificence defy description. Lower and lower we
go, drive close along the river&rsquo;s bank, and pass the night in
the <i>dak bungalow</i> of Kohala.</p>

<p>Next day we cross a bridge and slowly mount the slopes
of the left bank. The morning is beautifully fine, and the
not over-abundant vegetation of the hills exhales an agreeable
summer perfume. On our left rushes the stream, often
white with foam, but its roar strikes our ears only when we
make a halt; at other times it is drowned by the rattle of
the <i>tonga</i>. I follow with the closest attention the changes
of scenery in this wonderful country. The road is carried
through some of the mountain spurs in broad vaulted
tunnels. The last of these is the longest, and opens its
gaping jaws before us like a black cavern. Within it is
delightfully cool; the short warning blasts of the signal
horn reverberate melodiously in the entrails of the
mountain.</p>

<p>In Gurie we breakfast, and rest a quarter of an hour on
a comfortable couch in the verandah. Here, four years
previously, I spent a memorable hour with Sir Robert and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
Lady Harvey. The wind whistles through the same
poplars, elms, and willows to-day; I feel extraordinarily
forlorn and melancholy. Then I had come from a great
journey, now the future seems to me hopelessly dark.
Before me rise the softly rounded but steep slopes of the
wooded mountains on the right side of the valley; down
yonder the village of Gurie lies on both sides of the river.
The air is mild. I dream of eternal spring and forget my
cares. Beyond Chinawari tall conifers are again seen on
the cliffs. My driver, who speaks Persian, points to a huge
block of stone embedded in the margin of the road; ten
days ago it fell and killed a man and two horses. At
dangerous spots, where landslips may be expected, small
white flags are stuck up. The mountain landscape becomes
wilder, and its sharp outlines become more distinct in the
shades of evening. We come to Urie and Rampur and
often drive through dense forest. When we arrive at
Baramula we have covered 106 miles in fourteen hours.</p>

<p>On June 17 it rained in torrents, but we determined in
spite of it to travel the last six stages to Srinagar. We
canter along the straight road between endless rows of
poplars. The mud splashes up, the rain beats on the roof
of the <i>tonga</i>, heavy clouds involve us in semi-darkness, and
there is not a trace of the mountains to be seen. The
weather suits the mood in which I arrive at Srinagar, the
capital of Kashmir on the bank of the Jhelam. Here
I had to make several preparations for my journey&mdash;to
Turkestan, it was stated officially; there was no more talk
of Tibet. The persons whom I called upon on the first
day of my sojourn in the capital of the Maharaja were
away, but at last I found the superintendent of the Mission
Hospital in Srinagar, Dr. Arthur Neve. In 1902 he had
treated my sick cossack, Shagdur, and rendered me many
other services, for which I owe him an eternal debt of
gratitude. One of my best friends in India had advised me
to try to persuade Dr. Arthur&rsquo;s brother, Dr. Ernest Neve,
to accompany me, but now I learned that he too had applied
for permission to visit western Tibet, chiefly in connection
with missionary work round about Rudok, and had likewise
met with a refusal; he was now on his way back from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
Tibetan frontier above Leh. Dr. Arthur Neve is one of
the men I most admire. He has devoted his life to the
Christian Mission in Kashmir, and his hospital is one of the
best and most completely equipped in India. There he
works indefatigably day and night, and his only reward is
the satisfaction of relieving the sufferings of others.</p>

<p>This day everything seemed to go wrong, and out of
spirits I returned to Nedou&rsquo;s Hotel just as the gong
announced eight o&rsquo;clock. I sat down at the long table
among some thirty ladies and gentlemen, all as strange to
me as I to them. But in some of the parties the conversation
turned on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard that Hedin is in Srinagar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, really? When did he come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day. Of course he wants to go to Tibet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he has been forbidden, and the Government
has orders to prevent him crossing the frontier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he can pass round Tibet and enter it from
the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has done it before, and can of course find the
way again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was exceedingly unpleasant to have to listen to this
conversation, and I almost drowned myself in my soup-plate.
I could scarcely understand how I could be thus
spoken of. It seemed as though the dreams and illusions
of my soul were sorted out, named, and ticketed, while my
corporeal part sat at the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i> and swallowed soup.
When we had happily arrived at the coffee I quietly withdrew,
and thereafter always ate in my own room. My
position was such that I had to avoid all contact with
Englishmen; they could do me no service, and I would on
no account reveal my real designs. What a difference from
any former journeys, which I had always commenced from
Russian soil, where every one, from the Czar to the lowest
<i>chinovnik</i>, had done everything to facilitate my progress!</p>

<p>Next day I called on the private secretary of the
Maharaja, the Pundit Daya Kishen Kaul, a stately, distinguished
man who speaks and writes English perfectly.
He carefully read through my letter of introduction, and
kindly promised to get everything ready for me as quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
as possible. During the conversation he took notes. His
agents were to receive his orders on that same day, mules
would be procured, four soldiers be told off to accompany
me during my whole journey, provisions, tents, and pack-saddles
be bought, and he would find a pleasure in fulfilling
all my wishes. No one would have an inkling that all this
was done for me; every outlay would be lost among the
heavy items entered under the heading &ldquo;Maintenance of
the Maharaja&rsquo;s Court.&rdquo; And Daya Kishen Kaul kept his
word and became my friend. The business proceeded
slowly, but still it did go forward. Not a word was spoken
of Tibet. I was ostensibly getting ready for a journey to
Eastern Turkestan, but his meaning smile told me that
he divined my intention.</p>

<p>Even at a base of operation where one has full liberty
it is not quite easy to get a caravan ready for the march;
how much more difficult here where I was in the midst of
intrigues and political vexations. But my self-respect and
energy were stimulated, and I felt certain of succeeding in
the end. The whole affair reminded me of a drama with
an interminable list of rôles; the complications were great
and I longed only for action. One act of the play was
performed at Srinagar, and I cannot pass it over, as it had
a sequel later on. When everything else had been denied
me from London the road to Eastern Turkestan still lay open.</p>

<p>On June 22 I received from the Resident, Colonel
Pears, the following letter:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Indian Government has ordered me by telegraph not to
permit you to cross the frontier between Kashmir and Tibet. They
have no objections to your travelling to Chinese Turkestan, taking
it for granted that you have a Chinese passport. But as you have
lately informed me that you do not possess such a document, I
have telegraphed to the Indian Government for further instructions.</p>
</div>

<p>Now I telegraphed to the Swedish Minister in
London, Count Wrangel, and begged him to procure me a
passport for Eastern Turkestan, a country I never thought
of visiting, and then informed the Government in Simla of
this step and of the satisfactory reply. Nineteen days
later I received the following letter from Sir Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
Younghusband, who meanwhile had arrived in Kashmir as
the new Resident:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>I have received a telegram from the Government informing
me that you may set out before the arrival of the Chinese passport,
but on the condition that you do not travel beyond Leh. As soon,
however, as the Chinese Government, or the Swedish Minister
(in London), telegraphs that your passport is drawn out, you may
cross the Chinese frontier at your own risk; your passport will then
be sent after you.</p>
</div>

<p>Then I telegraphed to Count Wrangel again, asking him
to assure the Indian Government that the passport had
really been granted me and was already on the way. It
was already awaiting me in Leh when I arrived there. It
was a pure formality, for I did not need it, and it would have
to be decided first where the boundary lay between Eastern
Turkestan and Tibet. The representative of China in
London subsequently expressed his astonishment to Count
Wrangel that I was travelling about in Tibet with a passport
made out for Eastern Turkestan, but Count Wrangel replied
very justly that he could not possibly control me and the
roads I followed in Asia. The English Government had
done its best to prevent my travelling through Tibet, and so
there was no resource left but to outwit my opponents.
How I succeeded will appear in the pages of this book.</p>

<p>On one of the first days, accompanied by Daya Kishen
Kaul, I called on the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Sir
Pratab Sing, whose brother, Emir Sing, was also present.
His Highness is a little middle-aged man of dreamy,
melancholy aspect (Illustration 7). He received me with
great friendliness, and promised to meet my wishes in
every respect. He had heard of my journey through the
desert in 1895, and when I had narrated its incidents I had
won him over to my side; he would be pleased, he assured
me, to see my new expedition start from his territory.</p>

<p>On June 29 I was invited to a great fête at the
Maharaja&rsquo;s palace in honour of the Emperor&rsquo;s birthday.
The birthday of the King of England falls on November 9,
but the Emperor of India was born on June 29. How that
happens I do not know. At the appointed time I went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
Younghusband, and at the quay of the Residence we were
taken on board a <i>shikara</i> of the Maharaja&mdash;a long, elegantly
decorated boat, with soft cushions and an awning with
hanging fringes and tassels, and manned by about twenty
rowers in bright red clothing. We glide swiftly and noiselessly
down the Jhelam, see palaces, houses, and thick
groves reflected picturesquely in the swirling ripples, sweep
past numerous house-boats and canoes, and come to a halt
a little below the bridge at the staircase to the palace, where
Emir Sing received us on the lowest step in the red uniform
of a major-general. On the platform above the steps the
Maharaja awaited us. And then we mingled with the
varied crowd of Englishmen and natives, all decked out in
their best. Then a court was held; all the guests filed
past in slow single-file, and His Highness distributed
friendly shakes of the hand and nods. Then in the
same order all sat down in rows of chairs, just as in a
theatre. But we did not rest long, for soon dinner was announced,
and we made free with what kitchen and cellar
provided. After the feast was over, the Maharaja, his brother,
and his little nephew, the heir to the throne, entered
the hall and took their places at the middle of the
table at which we sat. The Maharaja called for a cheer
for the King-Emperor, another toasted Younghusband, who
returned thanks in a neat and partly humorous speech.
Then the guests were invited to go out into an open gallery
with thick pillars, where they witnessed a display of fireworks.
Between suns and Bengal fires, rockets and
serpents flew into the air from boats lying on the river, and
on the further bank &ldquo;God save the King-Emperor&rdquo; was
spelled out in red lamps. Taste and elegance had been
less studied than noise; there were detonations and sprays
of fire in every nook and corner, and the whole gave
an impression of unswerving loyalty. When we went down
to our boat again all around was veiled in darkness;
brilliant light streamed only through the colonnade of the
palace façade. We rowed upstream and enjoyed a more
beautiful and quieter illumination; the moon threw sinuous
lines of gold across the ripples of the river, and flashes of
blue lightning darted over the mountains on the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span></p>

<p>The Pundit Daya Kishen Kaul Divan Sahib was unwearied
in his kind efforts. He procured me forty mules,
which he bought from the Raja of Poonch. I rejected four;
the rest were in good condition, but they were of a less sturdy
breed than the Tibetan, and all foundered in Tibet. He
also furnished me with an escort of four soldiers who
had been in the service of the Maharaja. Two of them,
Ganpat Sing and Bikom Sing, were Rajputs, and spoke
Hindustani; they had certificates of good conduct, and the
former wore a service medal. Like the cook Manuel, they
declared themselves prepared to sacrifice their lives for me,
but I calmed them with the assurance that our campaign
would not be so bloody. Fortunately both belonged to the
same caste, so that they could mess together; but, of course,
they could not eat with other mortals. In camp I always
saw them seated at their own fire a good distance from the
others. The two others were Pathans, Bas Ghul from Cabul,
and Khairulla Khan from Peshawar. Daya Kishen Kaul
provided all with guns and ammunition at my expense, and
their pay was fixed. They also received money for their
outfit, and I prepared them to expect cold. My amiable
benefactor looked after tents for me, saddles, pack-saddles,
and a number of other necessary articles. Meanwhile
I made purchases myself in the bazaars. I got about
twenty <i>yakdans</i>, small leather-covered wooden boxes such
as are used in Turkestan; kitchen utensils and saucepans;
furs, ordinary blankets and frieze blankets; a tent-bed with
mattress and a gutta-percha undersheet; warm material
and <i>bashliks</i>; caps, Kashmir boots, cigars, cigarettes and
tobacco for a year; tea, and several hundred boxes of preserved
meat; also woven stuffs, knives, daggers, etc., for
presents, and no end of other things (Illustrations 10, 14).</p>

<p>In all my purchases and transport arrangements I
received invaluable help from Cockburn&rsquo;s Agency. It
provided me with stores of rice, maize, meal and barley;
for it was impossible to get together sufficient quantities
in Leh. It also looked after the transport of this heavy
baggage, and I had every reason to be satisfied with its
arrangements. I had myself brought a boat with oars,
rudder, mast, sails, life-buoys and centre-board, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
large chests I had sent out to India. Then I had the
same scientific instruments as before: an alt-azimuth,
two chronometers, meteorological instruments, compasses,
photographic apparatus and plates, writing-blocks, sketch-and
note-books, writing materials, field-glasses, hunting-rifles,
revolvers, etc.</p>

<p>Burroughs and Wellcome of London had been so kind
as to present me with an unusually complete medicine-chest,
which was in itself a tasteful and elegant work of
art, and contained drugs specially selected for a high, cold,
and dry climate. All the remedies were in tabloids, well
and orderly packed, and could easily be found with the
aid of a printed catalogue. The whole was carefully
stowed in a pretty aluminium chest which shone like silver.
The medicine-chest was from the first exceedingly popular
in the caravan; every one had a blind confidence in it.
I had a suspicion that many ailments were feigned just to
get another look at the chest. At any rate it contained the
best portable medical outfit I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I had some difficulty in finding an assistant for meteorological
observations. There was none at the Central
Institute in Simla, and therefore I applied to the Meteorological
Station in Srinagar. The chief recommended a youngster
to me who had been assistant at the station and had
been baptized under the name of Rufus, but he was a
fat Bengali, who always walked about with an umbrella
even when it did not rain. I was not troubled about his
corpulence; he would soon be cured of that on the mountains;
but, what was worse, he had certainly never seen
an aneroid barometer, and I could not, try as I would,
teach him to read it. I therefore dismissed him, for at
the worst I could read the instruments, though I had a
superabundance of other things to do.</p>

<p>Then just at the right moment a Eurasian, three-and-twenty
years old, presented himself, named Alexander
Robert. In his first letter to me he gave himself no other
title than the very correct one of a &ldquo;stranger in Srinagar&rdquo;;
this indicated modesty. He came to my hotel, showed me
his testimonials, which were all excellent, and he struck me
as a pleasant, strong, and healthy man. Among other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
employments he had worked on the railway at Peshawar
and had been an assistant in Dr. Neve&rsquo;s hospital. Dr.
Neve recommended him most warmly, and as, besides, he
acquired a good knowledge of the instruments after a
single lesson and needed only a few days&rsquo; practice in
Srinagar in handling and reading them, I was very glad
to engage him. He left his mother and young wife at home,
but they were in no straits, and a part of his wages was paid to
him in advance. I did not regret taking him, for he had a
knowledge of many things, was capable, cheerful, and ready
for work of any kind. When I knew him better I entrusted
all my cash to his care, and could do it without
hesitation, for his honesty was beyond suspicion. He
was a companion to me during the long winter evenings,
was a favourite in the caravan and among the Tibetans, and
carefully watched that every one did his duty. Robert was only
once a cause of grief to me, when he left me in December
1907, in consequence of sad news he received of his family
through Gartok (Illustration 13).</p>

<p>After Robert joined me matters went on more easily.
He superintended the packing of the baggage and the
weighing of it out into equal loads, and helped me in
stowing and distributing the heavy money-bags which
held 22,000 silver and 9000 gold rupees. Thus the days
passed, and at last the hour of release struck. I had
longed for it as for a wedding feast, and counted the
intervening hours. I took leave of my old friend Younghusband,
who at the last moment recommended to me a
caravan leader, Muhamed Isa of Leh, and bade farewell
to the Maharaja, Emir Sing, and Daya Kishen Kaul; and
Mrs. Annie Besant, who on several occasions had shown

<p>My people were ordered to be ready on the morning
of July 16, 1906, in the courtyard of the hotel (Illustration
16). The start should be delayed not a day longer;
I had now waited long enough. It was evident that
some hours would be required to get all in marching
order for the first time. At eight o&rsquo;clock the men from
Poonch came with their mules, but only to tell me that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
must have 5 rupees each for new clothes. The purchase
of these articles of clothing took up four more hours, and
in the afternoon the preparations had progressed so far
that there was only the loading-up to see after. Some hours
elapsed before the pack-saddles and loads had been adjusted.
The mules were very excited, danced round in circles,
and kicked so that the boxes flew about, and at last
each animal had to be led by a man (Illustration 17).
The hired horses were more sensible. Manuel on his steed
presented rather a comical appearance: he had never
mounted a horse in his life, and he looked frightened; his
black face shone in the sun like polished iron. The whole
company was taken by at least half-a-dozen amateur photographers
(Illustration 18). At length we moved off in detachments,
exactly twelve hours behind time; but the
long train was at any rate on the way to Gandarbal and
Tibet&mdash;and that was the main thing. What did it matter
what time it was? Feeling as though my prison doors
were opened, I watched my men pass along the road
(Illustration 10), and the whole world lay open before me.</p>

<p>Of all these men none knew of the glow of delight
within me; they knew me not, and I did not know them;
they came from Madras, Lahore, Cabul, Rajputana, Poonch,
and Kashmir, a whole Oriental congress, whom chance
had thrown together. They might as well be robbers
and bandits as anything else, and they might think that
I was an ordinary <i>shikari sahib</i> whose brain was filled with
no other ideal but a record in Ovis Ammon&rsquo;s horns.
I watched the start almost pitifully, and asked myself
whether it would be vouchsafed to them all to return
home to wife and child. But none was obliged to follow
me, and I had prepared them all for a trying campaign
of eighteen months. What would it have profited me to
have made them anxious by anticipating troubles? Trying
days would come soon enough.</p>

<p>I was most sorry for the animals, for I knew that famine
awaited them. As long as there were opportunities they
should satiate themselves with maize and barley that they
might subsist as long as possible afterwards on their own fat.</p>

<p>At length I stood alone in the yard, and then I drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
to Dal-dervaseh, where a long, narrow, five-oared boat
awaited me at the stone steps, and placed myself at the
tiller, when the boat put off and I was at last on the way
to the forbidden land. All the long journey through Persia
and Baluchistan had been only a prologue, which had
really no result except to land me in the spider&rsquo;s nest
in which I found myself caught in India. Now, however,
I was free, out of the reach of all that is called Government;
now I could rule, myself.</p>

<p>The canal, on the bright mirror of which we now glided
along, was varied by water plants, ducks, and boats, almost
sinking under their loads of country produce. On the banks
washerwomen crouched, and here and there a group
of merry children were bathing; they scrambled up projecting
points and mooring places, let themselves tumble
into the canal, splashed and threw up the water like small
whales. The canal becomes narrower, only a few yards
broad, our boat takes the ground, and the oarsmen get out
and draw it over the shallows. The waterway is very
winding, but runs on the whole to the north; the water is
shallow, but the current is with us. On either side stand
picturesque houses of wood and stone as in a street of
Venice. At every corner the eye encounters a new charming
subject for the brush, which gains additional effect from
the motley figures, the vegetation, and the light lancet-shaped
boats. The lighting up of the picture is also fine
now that the sun is setting, bathing everything in its warm
glowing beams, and causing the outlines to stand out clearly
against the deep shadows. Between the houses the water
is as black as ink. We draw near to a small projecting
height, behind which the road runs to Kangan and Leh.
Side branches debouch into the canal, but we make for a
lake called Anchar; its water is greyish blue, and comes
from the Sind, or Send as they here pronounce the name
of the river.</p>

<p>After a while eddies and sandbanks show that we are
in the river. The sun has set; the summer evening is
quiet and peaceful, only the gnats buzz over the water.</p>

<p>Though the rowers work steadily, putting forth all their
strength, we make slow progress, for the current is strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
against us. I have therefore opportunity to peep into the
domestic affairs of a whole series of English families in the
house-boats. It is just upon nine o&rsquo;clock and the inmates
are gathered round the table in dress coats and
elegant toilets. At one table sat three young ladies; I
thought that they had spent too much trouble over their
toilet, for there was nowhere any sign of a cavalier to
be charmed with their appearance. Through the open
windows the glaring lamplight fell on the water; they
saw us pass, and perhaps puzzled their heads over the
reason of so late a visit. Now the century-old planes of
Gandarbal appear, we row into a creek of stagnant water
and go on shore.</p>

<p>This was my first day&rsquo;s journey, but the day was far
from being over. Scouts were sent out, but not a soul was
to be found at the appointed halting-place. We settled
down between mighty tree-trunks and lighted a blazing
signal fire. After a time Bas Ghul comes like a highway
pad into the light of the flames; he leads a couple of
mules, and at ten o&rsquo;clock Robert and Manuel also lie
beside our fire. But the tents and provisions are not yet
here. At eleven scouts are sent out again, and we do not
see or hear of them again before midnight; they report that
all is well with the caravan and that it will soon be here.
But when one o&rsquo;clock came another scout vanished in the
darkness and it was not till a quarter to three that my
people arrived, after I had waited quite five hours for them.
But I was not at all angry, only happy to be <i>en route</i>.
New fires and resinous torches were lighted, and illuminated
brightly the lower branches of the plane trees, while through
the crowns the stars twinkled above our first bivouac on
the way to Tibet.</p>

<p>What noise and confusion in this throng of men and
baggage animals! The place was like a fair where all scold
and scream and no one listens. The escort tried in vain to
get a hearing, the Rajputs were quieter, but the Pathans
abused the disobedient Kashmiris and the saucy men from
Poonch as robbers and murderers. The animals were
tethered with long cords to the foot of the trees, and on a
small open space my tent pegs were for the first time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
driven into the ground. The tent was a present from my
friend Daya Kishen Kaul, and was my home for a long
time. The baggage was piled up in walls of provision
sacks and boxes, and Manuel got hold at length of his
kitchen utensils and unpacked his enamelled ware. The
animals neighed and stamped and occasionally gave their
neighbours a friendly kick, but when the barley nose-bags
were carried round and hung on their necks only a whinnying
was heard, which signified impatience and a good
appetite. And then these children of the East, this
gathering of dark-skinned men who strode about in the red
firelight with tall white turbans&mdash;what a fine striking picture
on the background of a pitch-dark night! I smiled to myself
as I saw them hurrying hither and thither about their
numerous affairs.</p>

<p>But now dinner is ready in the lighted tent, and a box
lid serves as a table. A carpet, a bed, two boxes for daily
use, and the young dogs are the only furniture. There
are three of the last, of which two are bitches. They
are pariahs; they were enticed away from the street in
Srinagar and have no trace of religion (Illustration 12).
Robert and I, who always speak English, call the white and
the yellow ones simply &ldquo;Puppy&rdquo;; the third soon received
the name of &ldquo;Manuel&rsquo;s Friend,&rdquo; for Manuel and he always
kept together.</p>

<p>And all this company which the sport of fortune had
collected around me was to be scattered again, one after the
other, like chaff before the wind. I was the only one who,
six-and-twenty months later, reached Simla again, and the
last of all the men and animals who now lay in deep sleep
under the planes of Gandarbal.</p>

<p>But I was not the last to lay myself down to rest on
this first night, for when I put out my light at three o&rsquo;clock
the firelight still played on the side of the tent, and I
seemed to feel the brisk life out in Asia like a cooling
breath of pine forests and mountains, snowfields and
glaciers, and of broad open plains where my plans would
be realized. Should I be tired of it? Nay, should I ever
have enough of it?</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER III</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE ROAD TO LEH</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> day ended late. Next morning I was awaked late, and
the sun stood high in the heavens before we were ready to
start. It took four hours to get the whole camp under weigh,
to pack up and load the animals; but the work would
be done more expeditiously when all knew their parts.</p>

<p>The long train begins to move, troop after troop disappears
among the trees. On both sides of the road
country houses and villages peep out between willows,
walnut and apricot trees, and small channels of water
murmur through the rice-fields, where men are hoeing,
moving in regular order, and singing a rhythmical encouraging
song; the singing lightens the work, for the
weeds are torn up in time with the air, and no one likes to
be behind another.</p>

<p>A bridge crosses the Sind, which rolls its greyish blue
water, rushing and roaring, through several large arms.
Now the road ascends the valley of the river, then we turn
eastwards, and soon the broad valley of Kashmir with its
level country disappears behind us. The rise is already
noticeable, and we are glad of it, for the day is warm.
Trees become fewer, and we ride for greater and greater
stretches in the blazing sun; but all around us is green and
abundantly watered, the mild air is full of life and productive
energy, and the whole valley resounds with the
roar of the river and the echo it calls forth. I have passed
this way twice before, but on both occasions the Sind valley
was covered with snow; now summer reigns in the deep
hollows and on the heights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span></p>

<p>At Kangan we pitched our tents in a thick copse. This
time the camp was marked out and the tents set up fairly
expeditiously. The <i>Numberdar</i> of the village procured us
everything we wanted&mdash;we did not wish to touch our own
stores until it became impossible to obtain local supplies.
The four coolies who had carried the boat were here relieved
by four others, who were to carry it up to Gunt.</p>

<p>So we had accomplished another day&rsquo;s journey. We all
delighted in the free, active life. But the day was declining,
the shadows grew longer, the sun disappeared an hour
sooner than usual, for it was concealed by the mountains,
and after we had listened for a while to the plaintive bark
of the jackals we also went early to rest. In the stillness
of the night the roar of the stream sounded still louder; its
water came from the heights which were the goal of our
hopes; but with still greater longing would my eyes one
day watch these eddies on their way to the sea.</p>

<p>When I came out of my tent in the cool of the morning
the rest of the caravan had already set out, and the camp
looked empty and deserted. The new day was not promising,
for it rained hard, and thunder growled among the
mountains; but the summer morning gave forth an odour
of forest and fresh green vegetation, and after a good
breakfast my detachment, to which Robert and Manuel
belonged, started on its march.</p>

<p>The sun soon came out, and with the warmth great
swarms of flies, which tortured our animals and made them
restive. The road ran down to the river and through the
trees on its right bank. On the crest of the left flank of
the valley some patches of snow still defied the summer
sun, and the wood opposite was much thicker than on our
side. Here and there a conifer raised its dark crown above
the lighter foliage. At the village Mamer, where a mill-wheel
swished through the waterfall, and an open booth
invited the traveller to refresh himself, Khairullah remained
awhile behind in company with a smoking narghilé. At
Ganjevan we crossed the river by three shaking bridges. In
the background of the narrowing valley rose a mountain
covered with snow. The scenery was fine, and we enjoyed
a ride really elevating in a double sense. Our caravan had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
to halt several times when a mule threw off its load; but
the animals were already quieter, and I looked forward with
anxiety to the time when they would become meek as
lambs, and when no objurgations would induce them to
move on.</p>

<p>The camp at Gunt was already in order when we
arrived. My first thought is always for the puppies; in the
morning, during the first hours of the march, they whine,
finding the movement of the mule very uncomfortable, but
the rocking soon sends them to sleep. But as soon as they
are taken out of the basket they fall foul of one another, and
then they wander all the evening among the tents, gnawing
and tearing at everything.</p>

<p>Even with a temperature of 52.2° F. I felt so cold in the
night, after the heat of the plains, that I woke and covered
myself with a fur rug. The river in the morning marked
only 46.2°. Upstream the view became ever finer. Sometimes
we rode through narrow defiles, sometimes up steep
dangerous slopes, sometimes over broad expansions of the
valley with cultivated fields. Then the precipitous rocks
drew together again, and cool dense shadows lay among
willows and alders. The roar of the stream drowned all
other sounds. The river had now become smaller, so many
tributaries having been left behind us, but its wild impetuosity
and its huge volumes of dashing water were the more
imposing; the water, greenish blue and white, foaming and
tossing, boiled and splashed among huge blocks of dark
green schist. In a gully, close to the bank, a conical avalanche
still lay thawing, and up above small waterfalls
appeared on the slopes like streaks of bright white paint.
When we came nearer we could perceive the movement, and
the cascades that resolved themselves into the finest spray.</p>

<p>Then the valley spread out again, and conifers alone
clothed its flanks. We bivouacked at Sonamarg, where I
set out some years before from the <i>dak bungalow</i> on a
winter&rsquo;s night, with lanterns and torches, for a venturesome
excursion over the avalanches of the Zoji-la Pass.</p>

<p>The Governor of Kashmir had sent a <i>chaprassi</i> with me,
and at a word from him all the local authorities were at our
service. But it was not easy to keep some of the members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
of the caravan in order. Bas Ghul and Khairullah proved
to be great brawlers, who began to quarrel with the others
on every possible occasion. Bas Ghul evidently considered
it his chief duty to appropriate a coolie for his own
service, and Khairullah thought himself much too important
to help in unloading. The others complained daily of
annoyance from the Afghans, and I soon saw that this escort
would give us more trouble than help. Among the rest,
also, the Kashmiris and the men from Poonch, there were
petty pilferers, and the Rajputs were ordered to watch that
none of our belongings went astray. In Baltal there was a
great commotion, for people from Sonamarg appeared and
declared that my servants had stolen a saucepan as they
passed through. And it was actually found among the
Poonch men. The complainants received their pan back
again as well as compensation for their trouble (Illustration 19).</p>

<p>The state of the road from Baltal over the Zoji-la Pass
was very different now from what it was in the year 1902.
Then the whole country was covered with snow, and we
slided almost the whole way down over glaciated slopes.
Now some five hundred workmen were engaged in mending
the road up to the pass. Their industry was indicated by
thundering blasts, and now and then great blocks of stone
fell down uncomfortably near to us.</p>

<p>Now our heavily-laden caravan had to cross the pass.
Slowly and carefully we march up over hard and dirty but
smooth avalanche cones, in which a small winding path has
been worn out by the traffic. Water trickles and drops in
the porous mass, and here and there small rivulets issue
from openings in the snow. After a stretch of good road
comes a steep slope along a wall of rock&mdash;a regular staircase,
with steps of timber laid across the way. It was a hard
task for laden animals to struggle up. Now and then one
of them slipped, and a mule narrowly escaped falling over&mdash;a
fall from the steep acclivity into the deep trough of the
roaring Sind would have been almost certain destruction,
not a trace of the unfortunate beast would have been found
again. From our lofty station the river looked like a thread.
After some sacks of maize had fallen overboard, each of the
animals was led by two men.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span></p>

<p>The train advanced slowly up. Piercing cries were
constantly heard when one of the animals was almost lost.
But at last we got over the difficulties, and travelled over
firm snow and level ground. The thawed water from a
huge cone of snow on the south side flowed partly to the
Sind, partly to the Dras. The latter increased with
astonishing quickness to a considerable river, and our small
and slippery path followed its bank. A treacherous bridge
crossed a wild tributary, with agitated waters of a muddy
grey colour. One of the mules broke through it, and it was
only at the last moment that his load could be saved. Then
the bridge was mended with flat stones for the benefit of
future passengers.</p>

<p>The Dras is an imposing river; its waters pour over
numerous blocks that have fallen into its bed, and produce
a dull grinding sound. And this mighty river is but one of
the thousand tributaries of the Indus.</p>

<p>We reached Matayun in drizzling rain, and had
scarcely set up our camp when the caravan-men came to
loggerheads. We here overtook a hired contingent of
30 horses with forage. Their drivers had received orders to
travel as quickly as possible to Leh; but now it appeared
that they had remained stationary for several days, and
wanted to be paid extra in consequence. The authorities
in Srinagar had done their best to make my journey to Leh
easy, but there is no order in Kashmir. In Robert I had
an excellent assistant; he did everything to appease the
refractory men. I now saw myself that stringent measures
must be resorted to, and I waited impatiently for a suitable
occasion for interference. About three-fourths of the
Poonch men reported themselves ill; they wished to ride,
and that was the whole cause of their illness. The mules,
when not wanted, were to go unloaded, in order to
economize their strength, and on that account we had
hired horses in Srinagar. Some men had been kicked by
our hot-tempered mules, and now came for treatment.</p>

<p>Then we go on to Dras and Karbu. On the heights
above the Dras we pass the famous stone figures of Buddha,
and then we descend a narrow picturesque valley to Karbu.
The river constantly increases in volume, and presents a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
grand spectacle; small affluents fall between the rocks like
silver ribands, and spread out over the dejection fans.
The pink blossoms of the hawthorn wave gracefully in
the wind, which cools us during the hot hours of the day.
Fine dark juniper bushes, tall as cypresses, adorn the
right bank.</p>

<p>In front of the station-house in Karbu an elderly man
in a white turban came up to me. &ldquo;Good day, Abdullah,&rdquo;
I said to him, for I immediately recognized the honest
fellow who had helped me up over the snowfields of the
Zoji-la on the former occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Salaam, Sahib,&rdquo; he answered, sobbing, fell on his
knees and embraced my foot in the stirrup, after the
Oriental custom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go on a long journey with me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will follow you to the end of the world, if the
Commissioner Sahib in Leh will allow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will soon settle that. But, tell me, how have you
got on since we last saw one another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am the <i>Tekkedar</i> of Karbu, and provide passing
caravans with all they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, think over the matter till to-morrow, and
if you wish to accompany me, I have a post free for you
among my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need of consideration; I will go with you,
though I only get a rupee a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Abdullah was too old and infirm for Tibet, and the
conditions which he afterwards put before Robert were
much more substantial than he had represented them in
the first joy of meeting me again: 60 rupees monthly,
everything found, his own horse, and exemption from all
heavy work were now his demands. Consequently next
morning we bade each other an eternal farewell.</p>

<p>Now a traveller turned up from the preceding station,
and complained that the Poonch men had stolen a sheep
from him. As they denied it, I made the plaintiff accompany
us to Kargil, where the case could be tried before the
magistrate.</p>

<p>We approached the striking spot, where two valleys
converge and the Dras joins the Wakkha, passed the sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
rocky angle, and rode up close by the bank of the Wakkha.
The valley has a very great fall, and the powerful stream
rushes down in wild commotion, swells up and leaps over
the blocks in its way, or breaks into foaming, tumultuous
surge. Several old acquaintances and the Vezir Vezarat
himself came to meet us, and before we reached Kargil we
were accompanied by a whole cavalcade. We bivouacked
in a cool grove of poplars and willows, and intended to
rest the following day (Illustration 20).</p>

<p>This day brought some picturesque scenes. Surrounded
by the authorities of Kargil with the pundit Lashman
Das and the Vezir Vezarat at their head, I held judgment
over the heterogeneous rabble which had caused so much
embarrassment in the first week of my journey. Firstly,
all the Kashmiris, with their leader Aziza, were dismissed.
Then came the turn of their fellow-countrymen, who had
transported hither on hired horses the maize and barley
for our animals, and lastly we came to the Poonch men.
As regards the sheep-stealing the following procedure was
adopted. The suspected men were tied to a couple of
trees, and though there was a cool shade, they grew weary,
and after waiting three hours for a rescuing angel, confessed
all, and were thereupon sentenced to pay double the value
of the sheep. Then Khairullah stepped forward and interceded
for his friend Aziza; as his request was not granted
he was annoyed, and positively refused to undertake the
night watch. So he, too, was dismissed, and was allowed
to take with him the other Afghan, Bas Ghul, who suffered
from periodical fits of insanity, and was moreover a rogue.
It was quite a relief to me to get rid of these esquires of our
bodyguard. Of the original &ldquo;Congress of Orientalists&rdquo; in
Srinagar only four men now remained, namely, Robert,
Manuel, Ganpat Sing, and Bikom Sing.</p>

<p>When we left Kargil on July 26 we took with us 77
hired horses with their leaders, and the forage of the
animals formed 161 small heaps. A native veterinary surgeon
was to accompany us to see that the mules were well
tended. After we had bought all the barley we could
get hold of, our caravan had much increased, and the
weeding-out effected in Kargil made the succeeding days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
of our journey to Leh much more agreeable than the
previous.</p>

<p>At Shargul we passed the first lama temple on this
route; beyond Mullbe they gradually became more
numerous. At every step one finds evidence that one is
in the country of the lamas; the small white temples
in Tibetan style crown the rocky points and projections
like storks&rsquo; nests, and dominate the valleys and villages below
them. But a monk in his red toga is seldom seen; the
temples seem silent and abandoned among the picturesque
<i>chhorten</i> monuments and <i>manis</i>. The whole relief of the
country is now much more prominent than in winter, when
the universal snow-mantle makes all alike and obliterates
all the forms. The fantastic contours of the mountains
stand out sharply with their wild pinnacles of rock and
embattled crests, which above Bod-Karbu mingle with
the old walls and towers, of which only ruins are now
left.</p>

<p>On July 28 we crossed the river by a tolerably firm
bridge, and continued to ascend the valley which leads to
the Potu-la. Just beyond the pass the authorities of
Lamayuru came to meet us with flowers and fruits, and
each one, according to the custom of the country, offered
a rupee, which, however, we needed only to touch with
the hand. A little further the first <i>chhorten</i> appeared,
followed by a long row of others; the stone heaps pointed
towards the famous monastery of Lamayuru. Passing
round a projecting corner a little farther on, we had a
clear view of a small valley between lofty mountains, and
here rose a precipitous terrace of detritus, on which the
monastery is built. Some white buildings up there stood
out sharply against a grey background, and in the depths
of the valley cultivated fields spread out among a few
groups of trees (Illustration 21).</p>

<p>As soon as our party was visible from the valley,
music was heard, and long brass drums boomed from the
temple roofs with a deep, solemn, organ tone, which was
joyously echoed among the mountains. Would the lama
monasteries of Tibet give us such a friendly welcome? As
we entered the village, there stood there about thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
women in their best clothes, in fur-trimmed coloured mantles,
with blinkers firmly plaited into the hair, and with turquoises
on the top. All the inhabitants had turned out, and
formed a picturesque group round the band, which started
a deafening tune with its flutes and drums (Illustration 22).</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went up to the monastery, where
the prior and the monks received us at the main entrance.
They led us into the open court of the monastery, surrounded
by old buildings, <i>chhorten</i>, and flagstaffs. From
here one has a grand view of the valley which slopes down
to the Indus. Under dark masses of cloud, and in fine
rain, seven monks executed an incantation dance; they
had tied on masks of wild animals, evil spirits, and monsters
with laughing mouths, tusks for teeth, and uncanny
staring eyes. Their motley coats stood out like bells as
they danced, and all the time weird music was played.
How the monks must be wearied in their voluntary imprisonment!
Evidently their only relaxation is to display
their religious fanaticism before the inquisitive eyes of
passing strangers.</p>

<p>Immediately beyond the village we descend a dangerously
steep road in the small, narrow, and wild ravine
which leads to the Indus. The deep trough of the Dras
is crossed by small, neat wooden bridges, and after a
couple of hours&rsquo; journey one rides as through a portal into
the great, bright valley of the Indus, and has the famous
river before one. It is a grand sight, and I halt for some
time on a swinging wooden bridge to gaze at the vast
volume of water which, with its great load and its rapid
current, must excavate its channel ever deeper and deeper.
The station-house, Nurla, stands just above the river,
which tosses and roars under its windows.</p>

<p>The day had been broiling hot; the rocks and soil of this
grey, unfruitful valley seem to radiate out a double quantity
of heat, and even in the night the thermometer marked 61°.
Even the river water had a temperature of 54° in the daytime,
but still, though dirty-grey like porridge, it was a delicious
drink in the heat.</p>

<p>As far as Saspul we rode along the right bank close to
the river. Here the road is often dangerous, for it is cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
like a shelf in the steep wall of rock, and one feels at ease
only when the valuable baggage has passed safely. The
danger is that a pack-horse on the mountain-side may
thrust itself past another, and force this one over the edge
of the rock, so that one may in a moment lose one&rsquo;s instruments,
photographic apparatus, or sacks of rupees.</p>

<p>At Jera a small emerald-green foaming torrent dashes
headlong into the Indus, and is lost in its bosom&mdash;the clear
green water is swallowed up instantaneously by the muddy
water of the Indus. One is delighted by the constantly
changing bold scenery and the surprises encountered at
every turn of the road. The eyes follow the spiral of a
constantly moving vortex, or the hissing spray which the
wind whips off the crests of the waves. One almost envies
the turbid eddies of this water which comes from the forbidden
land, from Gartok, from the regions north of the
Kailas mountain, from the unknown source of the Indus
itself, whither no traveller has yet penetrated, and which
has never been marked down on a map.</p>

<p>The bridge of Alchi, with its crooked, yielding beams,
seemed just as dangerous as on my last visit, but its swaying
arch boldly spans the interval between the banks,
and during a pleasant rest in the shade the bridge was
reproduced in my sketch-book. The waves dashed melodiously
against the stone embankment of the road, and
I missed the sound when the route left the bank and
ascended to Saspul, where we were received with the usual
music and dancing-women (Illustration 26).</p>

<p>Basgho-gompa has a fine situation in a side valley of the
Indus. The monastery is built on the left side of the
valley, the white walls of three storeys, with balconies,
effective cornices and pennants, standing on a long cliff.
A quantity of <i>chhortens</i> and <i>manis</i> surround Basgho.
The sacred formula &ldquo;Om mani padme hum&rdquo; is carved on
a slab of green slate, and lizards, as green as the stone,
dart about over the words of eternal truth.</p>

<p>The first of August was the last day of our journey to
Leh. A bright, peaceful morning; the rays of the sun crept
warm and agreeably through the foliage of the apricot
trees, and threw green reflexions into the station-room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
We rode near the Indus as far as where the monastery,
Spittol, stands on its hill, beyond which the road turns
aside from the river and runs straight up to Leh, which is
visible from a distance, surrounded by verdant gardens.
Mohanlal, a merchant of Leh, who had undertaken a large
part of the final equipment of the expedition, came to meet
us, and, as we rode past an enclosed field of fine clover, told
me that he had bought it for my mules.</p>

<p>We dismounted at the gate of a large garden, and went
in. In the midst of the garden stands a stone house
among poplars and willows. It is usually the residence of
the Vezir Vezarat, the representative of Kashmir in Ladak,
but now it was to be my headquarters for twelve days.
Here I had a roof over my head for the last time for two
long years, and I found myself very comfortable in my
study up one flight of stairs. Robert occupied another
room, and an open, shady balcony was fitted up as a
meteorological observatory. Manuel and the two Rajputs
had the control of the ground-floor; in the courtyard
purveyors and new servants were continually coming and
going, and adjoining the garden was our stable, where the
newly obtained horses were posted in the open air.</p>

<p>Leh is the last place of any importance on the way to
Tibet. Here our equipment must be finally completed.
Nothing could be omitted; if we forgot anything we could
not obtain it afterwards. Here the silver stream of rupees
flowed away without intermission, but I consoled myself
with the thought that we should soon be in a country
where, with the best will in the world, we could not spend a
farthing. A large caravan sucks up money, as a vampire
blood, as long as it remains in inhabited cultivated lands;
but when all contact with human civilization is cut off, it
must live on its own resources; consequently, it gradually
dwindles and approaches its dissolution. As long as it is
at all possible we let the animals eat all they can; the best
clover to be had must be procured, and both horses and
mules must be so well tended that they can afterwards live
on their own fat and endure the hardships that await them.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Captain</span> Patterson was now Joint-Commissioner of the
province of Ladak. He received me from the first with
the greatest hospitality and kindness, and was one of the
finest men I have ever come in contact with. Having
a thorough knowledge of India, Ladak, and Tibet, he
was able to give me valuable hints and advice, and was
untiring in assisting to equip the great caravan, the
object of which was still, officially, Eastern Turkestan,
without overstepping his instructions by a hair&rsquo;s breadth.
I found in him a true friend, and after dinner, which I
always took at eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, we often sat
together till long after midnight, talking of the future of
Asia and the doings of the world.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">30. <span class="sc">Muhamed Isa.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Sir Francis Younghusband had recommended to me
a well-known caravan leader, Muhamed Isa. I had seen
him in Kashgar and Srinagar, and knew that he had been
present at the murder of the French explorer, Dutreuil de
Rhins, on June 5, 1894. During about thirty years he
had travelled in most parts of Central Asia, and was also
acquainted with many parts of Tibet. Besides a number
of shorter journeys which he had accomplished in the
service of various sahibs, he had also been Carey&rsquo;s and
Dalgleish&rsquo;s caravan leader on their great march through
Central Asia, and had served a couple of years under
Dutreuil de Rhins. He accompanied Younghusband on
his famous march over the Mustagh Pass (1887), and had
been his caravan leader in the campaign to Lhasa (1903-1904).
On Ryder&rsquo;s and Rawling&rsquo;s journey in the valley
of the upper Brahmaputra he had had the management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
of the baggage caravan. During all these journeys he
had acquired experience which might be very useful to
me, and I gratefully accepted Younghusband&rsquo;s proposal,
especially as Captain Patterson, in whose service Muhamed
Isa then was, did not hesitate to place him at my disposal.
Besides, Muhamed Isa spoke fluently Turki, Tibetan, and
Hindustani, and wished for nothing better than to accompany
me. Without knowing that he had been warmly recommended,
he had earnestly begged his master to allow him
to enter my service (Illustration 30).</p>

<p>His father was a man of Yarkand, his mother a
Lamaist of Leh. The mixed race of such unions is called
Argon, and is generally distinguished by physical power
and extraordinarily well-developed muscular structure.
Muhamed Isa also was a fine man, tall and strong as a
bear, with great power of endurance, reliable and honest,
and after a few days&rsquo; journey with him I found that my
caravan could not have been entrusted to better hands.
That the first crossing of Tibet was so successful was due
in great measure to his services. He kept splendid discipline
among the men, and if he were sometimes strict,
it was for the good of the caravan, and he permitted no
neglect of duty.</p>

<p>He entertained Robert and myself, and even the
caravan men, for hours together with tales of his fortunes
and his adventures in the service of other Europeans,
criticising some of his former masters without much reserve.
The remembrance of Dutreuil de Rhins especially
seemed to affect him; he frequently returned to his account
of the attack made on the unfortunate Frenchman.
He was also a good boaster, and declared that once in
midwinter he had carried a letter in ten days from Yarkand
to Leh, with all his provisions on his back&mdash;a journey that
an ordinary mortal takes a month to accomplish. But
there was no harm in his exaggerations; he was always
witty and amusing, always cheerful and ready for a joke,
and kept up the spirits of the rest in depressing circumstances.
Poor Muhamed Isa! How little we suspected,
when he and I set out together, that he would never return
to his wife and home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span></p>

<p>I had scarcely taken possession of my new dwelling
in Leh when Muhamed Isa appeared with a pleasant,
kindly &ldquo;Salaam, Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace be with you,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;you have not
changed much in all the years since we met in Kashgar.
Are you disposed to accompany me on a journey of two
years through the high mountains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish nothing better, and the Commissioner Sahib
has allowed me to report myself to you for service. But
I should like to know whither we are to travel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going northwards to Eastern Turkestan; you
will hear about our further movements when we have left
the last villages behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must know the details of your plan because of
the preparations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take provisions for horses and men for
three months, for it may happen that we shall be so long
without coming into contact with human beings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, surely, we must be making for Tibet&mdash;that is a
country I know as well as my house in Leh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are your terms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty rupees a month, and an advance of two hundred
rupees to leave with my wife at starting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! I take you into my service, and my first order
is: buy about sixty strong horses, complete our store
of provisions so that it may last three months, and get
together the necessary equipment for the caravan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very well what we want, and will have the
caravan ready to march in ten days. But let me suggest
that I be allowed to choose the servants, for I know the
men here in Leh, and can tell which are fit for a long trying
journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many do you want to manage the caravan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five-and-twenty men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, engage them; but you must be responsible
that only useful, honest men enter my service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may depend on me,&rdquo; said Muhamed Isa, and
added, that he knew it to be to his own interest to serve me
well.</p>

<p>During the following days Muhamed Isa was always on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
his feet, looking out for horses. It was not advisable for
many reasons to buy them all at once&mdash;for one thing, because
the prices would then rise; so we bought only five or six
each day. As, however, the peasants from the first asked
exorbitantly high prices, a commission of three prominent
Ladakis was appointed, who determined the real value of
the horses offered for sale. If the seller were satisfied with
the assessment, he was paid at once, and the horse was led
to his stall in our open stable. Otherwise, the seller went
away, but usually returned next day.</p>

<p>Altogether 58 horses were bought, and Robert made
a list of them: 33 came from various villages in Ladak,
17 from Eastern Turkestan, 4 from Kashmir, and 4 from
Sanskar. The Sanskar horses are considered the best,
but are difficult to get. The Ladak horses, too, are good,
for, being bred in the mountains, they are accustomed to
rarefied air and poor pasture; they are small and tough.
The Turkestan horses have, as a rule, less power of
endurance, but we had to take them for want of better,
and all ours had crossed the Karakorum Pass (18,540 feet)
once or oftener.</p>

<p>As the horses were bought they were numbered in the
list, and this number on a strip of leather was fastened to
the mane of the horse. Afterwards I compiled a list of the
dead, as they foundered, in order to ascertain their relative
power of resistance. The first that died was a Sanskar,
but that was pure chance&mdash;he died some days after we
marched out of Leh, of acute disease. Later on the losses
were greatest among the Yarkand horses. The prices varied
considerably, from 37 to 96 rupees, and the average price
was 63 rupees. A horse at 95 rupees fell after three
weeks; another, that cost exactly half, carried me a year-and-a-half.
The commission was very critical in its selection,
and Muhamed Isa inspected every four-legged
candidate before it was accepted. As a rule we did not
hesitate to take horses ten or twelve years old; the tried
horses were more reliable than the younger ones, though
these often appeared much more powerful. But not one of
them all was to return from Tibet; the lofty mountains let
none of their prey escape. &ldquo;Morituri te salutant,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
Captain Patterson forebodingly, as the first caravan passed
out of Leh.</p>

<p>The caravan, then, consisted of 36 mules and 58 horses.
It is always hard at the last to make up one&rsquo;s mind to
start; after a few days we should find ourselves in country
where we could procure nothing but what grows of itself
on the ground. Certainly we were in the very best season;
the summer grass was now in the greatest luxuriance, but
it would soon become more scanty, and in about ten days
we should reach a height where there was no pasturage.
Therefore it was necessary to take as much maize and
barley as possible with us, and here a difficulty came in:
we durst not overburden the animals with too heavy loads,
for then the strength of the caravan would be broken in the
first month, while, in the second month, it would come to
grief if we should find ourselves, as was most probable, in
a barren country. And as the days pass, the stores
diminish and come to an end just when they are most
wanted. In the first weeks we had the ascent to the
border region of the Tibetan plateau before us, and had
consequently to expect the most troublesome country to
traverse just at the commencement of the journey. Therefore
our first marches were short, and all the shorter
because the loads were heavier. This is a pretty complicated
problem for an army commissariat.</p>

<p>After consultation with Muhamed Isa I resolved to
hire an auxiliary caravan of 30 horses from Tankse to
accompany us for the first month and then return. Hence
arose a financial problem. The men of Tankse asked
35 rupees a month for each horse, or 1050 rupees in
all; of course they ran great risk, and I must therefore undertake
to pay 30 rupees for every horse that fell on the outward
journey, and 10 rupees for one that fell on the return
home. In the worst case, then, the cost would amount to
1950 rupees. On the other hand, if I bought these horses
at 60 rupees a head, the total expenditure would be 1800
rupees, and the horses would belong to me. Then the
old problem was repeated: I should have to take fodder
for these thirty horses, and engage ten men to attend
to them, and for these men provisions must be obtained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
After many pros and cons we at length decided to hire
the horses only, for then their owners would accompany
them at their own risk and supply themselves with rations
carried by seven yaks. The provisions for the first month
were to be taken from our own animals, to lighten their
loads and economize their strength; for a horse or mule
always gets tired at the beginning of the journey, and
must be spared. But if one of the hired horses became
exhausted, its owner was at liberty to send it home before
the expiration of the month.</p>

<p>As forage and grazing was dear in Leh, we sent off as
early as August 10, 35 mules and 15 horses with their loads,
and 15 men and a <i>chaprassi</i>, to Muglib, which lies beyond
Tankse and has good pastures. Sonam Tsering, whom
Captain Rawling had strongly recommended, was chosen
as leader of this caravan. He received 100 rupees for the
expenses of the caravan. Muhamed Isa accompanied it
part of the way to see that everything went on smoothly.</p>

<p>A few days after his engagement Muhamed Isa presented
to me 25 men, who, he proposed, should enter my service.
There was no difficulty in finding men willing to come;
all Leh would have followed me if wanted. The difficulty
was to make a proper choice, and appoint only
serviceable men who could fill their posts and understood
their duties.</p>

<p>It was a solemn moment when the main body of the caravan
assembled in my garden, but the spectacle had its
humorous side when Muhamed Isa, proud as a world-conqueror,
stepped forward and mustered his legions. At
my request Captain Patterson was present to have a look
at the fellows; he now delivered a short address, and impressed
on them how important it was for their own
sakes to serve me honestly. Their pay was fixed at 15
rupees a month, and half a year&rsquo;s pay was advanced to
them. The Rev. Mr. Peter was so kind as to undertake
to distribute the money to their families. Lastly, I promised
each a present of 50 rupees for good behaviour, and
bound myself to guarantee their journey home to Leh,
with expenses, from whatever place we might separate.</p>

<p>In the course of my narrative I shall have abundant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
opportunities of introducing these men individually to my
readers. Besides Sonam Tsering, already mentioned,
who had served under Deasy and Rawling, I will here
name old Guffaru, a greyheaded man with a long white
beard, who thirty-three years ago accompanied Forsyth&rsquo;s
embassy to Jakub Bek of Kashgar. He had seen the great
Bedaulet (&ldquo;the fortunate one&rdquo;) in all his pomp and state,
and had many tales of his experiences on Forsyth&rsquo;s famous
journey. I at first hesitated to take with me a man of sixty-two,
but he begged so earnestly; he was, he said, Muhamed
Isa&rsquo;s friend, and he was so poor that he could
not live if I did not employ him. He had the forethought
to pack up a shroud that he might be buried
decently if he died on the way. That everything should
be properly managed in such case, and that his outstanding
pay might be transmitted to his family, he took his son,
Kurban, with him. But Guffaru did not perish, but was in excellent
condition all the time he was with me (Illustration 31).</p>

<p>Another, on whom I look back with great sympathy
and friendly feeling, was Shukkur Ali. I had known him
in 1890 in Kashgar, where he was in Younghusband&rsquo;s
service, and he, too, remembered that I had once drawn
him in his master&rsquo;s tent. He was so unconsciously comical
that one almost died of laughter as soon as he opened his
mouth, and he was my oldest acquaintance among this
group of more or less experienced Asiatics. He had taken
part in Wellby&rsquo;s journey, and gave us the most ghastly
descriptions of the sufferings the captain, who afterwards
fell in the Boer War, and his caravan had to endure in North
Tibet, when all the provisions were consumed and all
the animals had perished. A year later he shared in
my boating trips on the holy lake, Manasarowar, and was
as useful as he was amusing. Shukkur Ali was an honest
soul, and a stout fellow, who did his work without being
told, quarrelled with no one, and was ready and willing
for any kind of service. He was always in the highest
spirits, even during a violent storm in the middle of the lake,
and I saw him weep like a child on two occasions only&mdash;at
the grave of Muhamed Isa, and when we said the
last good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span></p>

<p>These three were Mohammedans, as their names show.
The caravan contained eight sons of Islam in all; the
leader, Muhamed Isa, was the ninth. The other seventeen
were Lamaists. Then came two Hindus, a Catholic,
Manuel, and two Protestants, Robert and myself. I will
not vouch for the religious convictions of the Lamaists.
As regards some among them, I found that they sometimes
changed their religion. For instance, Rabsang, when he
travelled to Yarkand, was a Mohammedan and shaved his
head, but on the way to Tibet he was just as zealous a
believer in Lamaism.</p>

<p>The oldest of my companions was Guffaru, sixty-two, and
the youngest Adul, twenty-two, and the average age of the
whole company was thirty-three years. Eleven of these
men came from Leh, the others from different villages of
Ladak. Only one was a foreigner, the Gurkha Rub Das
from the frontier of Nepal. He was quiet and faithful, and
one of my very best men. It was a pity he had no nose;
in a hot scuffle in Lhasa an opponent had bitten off that important
and ornamental organ.</p>

<p>I may pass quickly over the equipment; it is always the
same. For the men rice, flour, <i>talkan</i>, or roasted meal,
which is eaten mixed with water, and brick tea in bulk were
taken. For myself several hundred tins of preserved meat,
tea, sugar, tobacco, etc., all provided by the merchant
Mohanlal, whose bill came to 1700 rupees. New pack-saddles,
ropes, frieze rugs, horse-shoes, spades, axes and
crowbars, bellows, cooking-pots, copper cans, and the cooking
utensils of the men with other articles cost nearly a
thousand rupees. The pack-saddles we had bought in
Srinagar were so bad that we had to have new ones
made, and Muhamed Isa enlisted some twenty saddlers,
who sewed all day under the trees of the garden. But
everything was ready in time and was of first-rate
quality. Captain Patterson declared that a better-found
caravan had never left Leh. How stupid I had been
to linger so long in Srinagar and associate with the lazy
gentlemen of the Maharaja. Everything that came from
there was either exorbitantly dear or useless. Only the
mules were good. Yet I always remember my sojourn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
in Srinagar with feelings of great thankfulness and
pleasure.</p>

<p>The Moravian missionaries in Leh rendered me invaluable
service. They received me with the same
hospitality and kindness as before, and I passed many a
memorable hour in their pleasant domestic circle. Pastor
Peter had endless worries over my affairs; he managed
both now and afterwards all the business with the new
retainers. Dr. Shawe, the physician of the Mission,
was an old friend I had known on my former journey,
when he treated my sick cossack, Shagdur, in the excellent
Mission Hospital. Now, too, he helped me both by word
and deed. He died in Leh a year later, after a life devoted
to suffering humanity.</p>

<p>Many of my dearest recollections of the long years I have
spent in Asia are connected with the Mission stations, and
the more I get to know about the missionaries the more I
admire their quiet, unceasing, and often thankless labours.
All the Moravians I met in the western Himalayas are
educated to a very high standard, and come out exceptionally
well prepared for the work before them. Therefore
it is always very stimulating and highly instructive to
tarry among them, and there is none among the Europeans
now living who can vie with these missionaries in their
knowledge of the Ladak people and their history. I need
only mention Dr. Karl Marx and Pastor A. H. Francke as
two men who are thoroughly at home in strictly scientific
archæological investigation.</p>

<p>Some young coxcombs, to whom nothing is sacred, and
whose upper storeys are not nearly so well furnished as
those of the missionaries, think it good form to treat the
latter with contemptuous superiority, to find fault with them,
to sit in judgment on them, and pass sentence on their
work in the service of Christianity. Whatever may be the
result of their thankless toil, an unselfish struggle for the
sake of an honest conviction is always worthy of admiration,
and in a time which abounds in opposing factors it
seems a relief to meet occasionally men who are contending
for the victory of light over the world. In Leh the
missionaries have a community which they treat with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
gentleness and piety, for they know well that the religion
inherited from their fathers has sunk deep into the bone
and marrow of the natives, and can only be overcome by
cautious, patient labour. Even the Ladakis who never visit
the Mission stations always speak well of the missionaries,
and have a blind confidence in them, for apart from their
Mission work they exercise an effect by their good example.
The Hospital is made great use of, and medical science is a
sure way of access to the hearts of the natives.</p>

<p>During the last days of my stay in Leh I saw my old friends
again, Mr. and Mrs. Ribbach, in whose hospitable house
I had spent many pleasant winter evenings four years
ago.</p>

<p>One day Captain Patterson proposed that I should go
with him to call on the wealthy merchant Hajji Nazer Shah.
In a large room on the first floor, with a large window
looking over the Indus valley, the old man sat by the wall,
on soft cushions, with his sons and grandsons around him.
All about stood chests full of silver and gold-dust, turquoise
and coral, materials and goods which would be sold in
Tibet. There is something impressively patriarchal about
Hajji Nazer Shah&rsquo;s commercial house, which is managed
entirely by himself and his large family. This consists of
about a hundred members, and the various branches of the
house in Lhasa, Shigatse, Gartok, Yarkand, and Srinagar
are all under the control of his sons, or their sons. Three
hundred years ago the family migrated from Kashmir to
Ladak. Hajji Nazer Shah is the youngest of three
brothers; the other two were Hajji Haidar Shah and
Omar Shah, who died some years ago leaving numerous
sons behind them.</p>

<p>The real source of their wealth is the so-called Lopchak
mission, of which they possess a monopoly. In accordance
with a treaty nearly 200 years old, the kings of Ladak
sent every third year a special mission to the Dalai Lama,
to convey presents which were a token of subjection to the
supremacy of Tibet, at any rate in spiritual matters. However,
after Soravar Sing, Gulab Sing&rsquo;s general, conquered
Ladak in 1841 and annexed the greater part of this country
to Kashmir, the Maharaja of Kashmir took over the duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
of carrying out the Lopchak mission, and always entrusted
it to one of the noblest, most prominent families of Ladak.
For some fifty years this confidential post has been in the
family of Nazer Shah, and has been a source of great profit
to them, especially as several hundred baggage animals
are provided for the mission gratis, for the journey from
Leh to Lhasa. A commercial agent is also sent yearly
from Lhasa to Leh, and he enjoys the same transport
privileges.</p>

<p>The mission had left eight months before under the
charge of one of the Hajji&rsquo;s sons. Another son, Gulam
Razul, was to repair in September to Gartok, where he is
the most important man in the fair. I asked him jokingly
if I might travel with him, but Hajji Nazer Shah replied
that he would lose the monopoly if he smuggled Europeans
into Tibet. Gulam Razul, however, offered me his services
in case I should be in the neighbourhood of Gartok, and I
afterwards found that this was not a mere polite speech.
He will play a most important part in this narrative. After
my return to India I had an opportunity of drawing attention
in high quarters to the importance to English interests
of his commercial relations in Tibet, and I warmly recommended
him as a suitable candidate for the much-coveted
title of Khan Bahadur, which he, indeed, received, thanks
to the kind advocacy of Colonel Dunlop Smith.</p>

<p>Now, too, he rendered me many valuable services;
perhaps the greatest was to take a considerable sum in
Indian paper in exchange for cash, part of which consisted
of a couple of bags of Tibetan <i>tengas</i>, which proved very
useful four months later.</p>

<p>The old Hajji was a fine Mohammedan of the noblest
type. He obeyed faithfully the commands of the Koran,
and five times daily tottered into the mosque to perform
his devotions. He had more than enough of the good
things of this world, for his extensive business connections
brought him in yearly a net profit of 25,000 rupees, and
his name was known and respected throughout the interior
of Asia. Before my return he had left the stage and taken
possession of his place, with his face turned towards Mecca,
in the Mohammedan graveyard outside the gate of Leh.</p>

<p>The small town itself is full of the most attractive and
fascinating examples of Tibetan architecture. On all sides
are seen quiet nooks with motley figures, temple portals,
mosques, houses rising one above another, and open shops,
whither customers flock; and the traffic became brisker
every day after the summer caravans from Yarkand over
the Kardang Pass began to arrive at Leh. Round the
town stands a crescent of bare, lumpy, sun-lighted hills; to
the south and south-east the dry gravelly plain slopes down
to the Indus, where a series of villages among green fields
and woods impart some life to the picture. On the farther
side is seen the Stokpa, a lofty summit, below which the
village Stokpa peeps out of a valley mouth. Here resides
an ex-king of the third generation, the Raja of Stok,
whose grandfather ruled as king of Ladak but was deprived
by Soravar Sing of his dignity and State.</p>

<p>The Raja of Stok, or, to give him his full name and
title, Yigmet Kungak Singhei Lundup Thinlis Zangbo
Sodnam Nampar Gelvela, Yagirdar of the state of Stok,
awakes one&rsquo;s sympathy in his somewhat sad position; he
is evidently painfully sensitive of the loss of the honour
and power which fate has denied him. He was on a visit
to Leh, for he owns an unpretending but pretty house in
the main street. The Tibetans still look upon him as the
true and rightful king, while the ruler of the country, the
Maharaja of Kashmir, is only a usurper in their eyes. We
therefore concluded that a letter of recommendation from
this Raja of Stok might be very useful some day or other.
He was evidently flattered by my request and quite ready
to grant it. In his open letter he ordered &ldquo;all men in
Tibet of whatever rank, from Rudok, Gartok, and Rundor
to Shigatse and Gyantse, to allow Sahib Hedin to pass
freely and unmolested, and to render him all necessary
assistance.&rdquo; This highly important document, with the
date and the red square seal of the Raja affixed, was afterwards
read by many Tibetan chieftains, on whom it made
not the slightest impression. They quietly answered:
&ldquo;We have only to obey the orders of the Devashung in
Lhasa.&rdquo; (Illustration 32.)</p>

<p>The old palace of Leh stands on its rock like a gigantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
monument of vanished greatness. From its roof one has
a grand view of the town, the Indus valley, and the great
mountains beyond the river. In the foreground stretch
fields of wheat and barley, still staringly green amidst the
general grey, small groups of garden trees, groves of
poplar, farm-houses, and small knobly ridges, while the
dreary Mohammedan graveyard stands out sharply and
obtrusively in the evening sunshine. Immediately below us
lies a chaos of quadrangular houses of stone or mud, with
wooden balconies and verandahs, interrupted only by the
main street and the lanes branching out of it. On the
point of a rock to the east is seen a monastery, for which
a lama gave the name of Semo-gungma. Semo-yogma
stands in the palace itself. The temple hall here is called
Diva, and the two principal images Guru and Sakya-tubpa,
that is, Buddha. The portal of the palace with its
pillars has a very picturesque effect. Through this portal
you enter a long, dark, paved entrance and then pass up a
stone staircase and through gloomy passages and corridors,
with small offshoots running up to balcony windows; in
the interior, however, you roam about through halls all
equally dark. No one dwells now in this phantom castle,
which fancy might easily make the scene of the most
extravagant ghost stories. Only pigeons, which remain for
ever young among the old time-worn monuments, coo out their
contentment and cheerfulness (Illustrations 28, 29, 33, 34).</p>

<p>Still the palace, in spite of its decay, looks down with
royal pride on the town far below, with its industry and
commercial activity, and on this central point on the road
between Turkestan and India. The wind sweeps freely
over its roof, its flat terraces, and breastwork with prayer
strips flapping and beating against their sticks. A labyrinth
of steep lanes lead up to it. Wherever one turns, the
eye falls on some picturesque bit: whole rows of <i>chhortens</i>,
one of which is vaulted over the road, small temples and
Lama houses, huts and walls.</p>

<p>On the hill behind Captain Patterson&rsquo;s bungalow lies a
burial-ground with the graves of five Europeans: the names
Stolicza and Dalgleish especially attract our attention.
Over Stolicza&rsquo;s grave a grand monument has been erected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
The inscription on a tablet in front informs us that he was
born in June 1838 and died in June 1874 at Murgoo, near
the Karakorum Pass. The Indian Government erected
the memorial in 1876 as a mark of respect and gratitude
for the service which Stolicza had rendered during the
journey of Forsyth&rsquo;s embassy. The same inscription is
repeated on the other side in Latin. Dalgleish&rsquo;s tombstone
is simpler, but is also adorned with a tablet of cast-iron.
He was born in 1853 and was murdered on the Karakorum
Pass in 1888. Both terminated their life pilgrimage in
the same country high above the rest of the world, and
both sleep their last sleep under the same poplars and
willows. Now the evening sun gilded the mountain crests,
reddish-yellow light fell on the graves and the trunks of
the poplars, a gentle wind murmured softly through the
tree-tops, and spoke in a melancholy whisper of the vanity
of all things; and a short time later, when the lamps in
the Government buildings had been lighted, champagne
corks popped at the farewell dinner given by Captain
Patterson to another pilgrim who had not yet ended his
lonely wanderings through the wide wastes of Asia (Illustration
36).</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> time at Leh passed quickly, as we were working at
high pressure, and the result of our efforts was a splendid
caravan in excellent order for the march. Robert and
Muhamed Isa seemed to be infected by my eagerness to
start, for they worked from morning to night and saw that
every one did his duty. I took leave of Captain Patterson,
who had helped us in so many ways, and on August 13
the loads of the second great caravan stood in pairs in the
outer yard, and had only to be lifted on to the pack-saddles
of the horses.</p>

<p>Muhamed Isa started at four o&rsquo;clock next morning, and
I followed a few hours later with Robert and Manuel, four
riding horses, and nine horses for our baggage. Hajji
Nazer Shah and his sons, our numerous purveyors, the
officials and pundits of the town, and many others, had
assembled to see us off, and sent us on our way with kind
wishes and endless &ldquo;Salaams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A crowd of beggars escorted us along the main street,
the merchant Mohanlal bowed to us from the steps of his
house, and we passed through the gate of the town into
the lanes of the suburbs. At the first turn the horse which
carried my boxes of articles for daily use became tired of
his burden and got rid of it at once. They were put on
another horse, which seemed quieter and carried them as
far as the Mohammedan burial-ground, when he, too, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
enough of them, shied, broke loose, disappeared among
some <i>chhortens</i>, and flung the boxes so violently to the ground
that it was a marvel that they did not fly to pieces among
the pebbles and blocks of stone. The jade got clear of
all the ropes in a second, and galloped, with the pack-saddle
dragging and dancing behind him, among the tombs in
which the Mohammedans sleep. That the boxes might
not be quite destroyed we hired a quiet horse for the day.
This is always the way at first, before the animals have got
used to their loads and pack-saddles. Here a couple of
buckets rattle on the top of a load, there the handle of a
<i>yakdan</i>, or, again, a pair of tent-poles jolt up and down
and knock together at every step. The rest in the stable
had made the horses nervous, the fragrant trusses of juicy
clover had made them sleek and fat, strong, lively, and ready
to dance along the road. Every horse had now to be led
by a man, and at length we came to the open country,
and our companions left us one after another, the last to
say farewell being the excellent, noble-hearted Mr. Peter.</p>

<p>Then we went down from Leh past innumerable <i>mani
ringmos</i> and through narrow gullies between small rocky
ridges, and so drew near to the Indus again. A rocky
promontory was passed, then another close to a branch of
the river, and then Shey came in sight with its small
monastery on a point of rock. The road runs through the
village, over canals by miniature stone bridges, over grassy
meads and ripening cornfields; here and there lies a swamp
formed by overflowing irrigation water. To our left rise
granitic rocks, their spurs and projections ground down and
polished by wind and water.</p>

<p>After we had lost sight of the river and ridden through
the village, where the people almost frightened our horses
to death with their drums and pipes, we found ourselves
in front of the monastery Tikze on a commanding rock,
with the village Tikze and its fields and gardens at the
foot. The tents were already pitched in a clump of willows.
The highway and its canal ran past it, and here stood our
mules and horses tethered in a long row before bundles of
fresh grass. The puppies were released immediately; their
basket was already too small for them; they grew visibly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
could bite hard, and began already to guard my tent&mdash;barking
furiously when they smelled anything suspicious.</p>

<p>Barely half an hour after the camp is set in order
comes Manuel with my tea and cakes. He is rather sore
after his day&rsquo;s ride, and looks dreadfully solemn, dark-brown
and shiny; he is darker than usual when he is cross.
Robert is delighted with his horse, and I have every reason
to be content with mine&mdash;a tall, strong, dapple-grey animal
from Yarkand, which held out for four months and died on
Christmas Eve. At Tikze we are much lower than at
Leh, and then we begin to mount up again. The day
had been very hot, and even at nine o&rsquo;clock the thermometer
stood at 70° F. Muhamed Isa is responsible for
my twenty boxes; he has stacked them up in a round pile
and covered them with a large tent, and here he has fixed
his quarters with a few other chief Ladakis. Robert and
Manuel have a tent in common; the kitchen, with its constantly
smoking fire, is in the open air; and the rest of the
men sleep outside (Illustration 39).</p>

<p>Now the new journey had begun in real earnest&mdash;we
were on the way to the forbidden land! I had had to
fight my way through a long succession of difficulties and
hindrances before reaching this day. Batum was in open
insurrection; in Asia Minor Sultan Abdul Hamid had
provided me with a guard of six mounted men to protect
me from robbers; in Teheran revolutionary tendencies were
even then apparent; in Seistan the plague was raging
fearfully; and in India I encountered the worst obstacle of
all&mdash;an absolute prohibition to proceed into Tibet from that
side. Then followed all the unnecessary complications in
Srinagar and on the way to Leh, and the stupid affair of
the Chinese passport which I did not need, but had so
much trouble to obtain. Does not this remind one of
the tale of the knight who had to overcome a lot of hideous
monsters and hindrances before he reached the princess on
the summit of the crystal mountain? But now at last I
had left behind me all bureaucrats, politicians, and disturbers
of the peace; now every day would take us farther
and farther from the last telegraph station, Leh, and then
we could enjoy complete freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span></p>

<p>On August 15, exactly twenty-one years had elapsed
since I started on my first journey in Asia. What would
the next year bring? the culminating point of my career
or a retrogression? Would opposition still continue, or
would the Tibetans prove more friendly than Europeans?
I knew not: the future lay before me as indistinct as the
Indus valley, where dark masses of cloud swept over the
mountains and the rain beat on the tent canvas. We let
it rain, and rejoiced to think that, if the precipitation extended
far over Tibet, the pasturage would be richer and
the springs would flow more freely.</p>

<p>After a short march we come to the village Rambirpur,
reconstructed thirty years ago, and to the right of the
road the small monastery Stagna-gompa stands on a
pinnacle of rock. On the left bank is seen the village
Changa, and a little higher up the well-hidden, small,
and narrow valley where the famous temple of Hemis
lies concealed. Thunder rumbles over its mountains as
though the gods stormed angrily on their altar platform.</p>

<p>At a corner where a small, shaky, wooden bridge spans
the Indus, stand some more long <i>mani ringmos</i>; they are
covered with well-cut stone flags, on which the letters are
already overgrown by a weathered crust, and stand out
dark against the lighter chiselled intervals. Former kings
of Ladak caused them to be constructed as a salve to their
consciences, and to gain credit in a future life. They are
a substitute for the work of the Lamas; every one is at
liberty to propitiate the divine powers by this means.
Thus the monks acquire a revenue, and every one, travellers
and caravans included, rejoices at the pious act, while the
stone slabs speak in their silent language of bad consciences
and manifold sins, in rain and sunshine, by day and night,
in cold and heat.</p>

<p>Now we leave the Indus for good and all. &ldquo;Farewell,
thou proud stream, rich in historical memories. Though
it costs me my life I will find some day thy source over
yonder in the forbidden land,&rdquo; I thought, as, accompanied
by <i>jamadars</i> and <i>chaprassis</i> of the Kashmir state and some
of my men, I turned the rocky corner into the side valley
through which the road runs up past the monasteries Karu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
and Chimre to the Chang-la Pass. The road now becomes
worse; every day&rsquo;s journey it deteriorates, sometimes
changing into an almost imperceptible footpath, and at last
it disappears altogether. The great road to Lhasa along
the Indus and to Gartok was closed to us.</p>

<p>Our company makes a grand show; a sheep is killed
every evening, and the pots boil over the fires in the centre
of the various groups which have combined into messes.
I make no attempt to learn the names of my new servants;
coolies and villagers are always moving about among them,
coming and going, and I scarcely know which are my own
men. It must be so in the meantime; the time will soon
come for me to know them better, when all outside elements
are removed. A melancholy air is heard in the darkness;
it is the night watchmen who sing to keep themselves
awake.</p>

<p>At Chimre we are at a height of 11,978 feet, and we
ascend all the day&rsquo;s journey to Singrul, where we find
ourselves 16,070 feet above sea-level. The road keeps
for the most part to the stony barren slopes on the left
side of the valley, while the brook flows nearer to the right
side, where bright green fields appropriate so much of its
water that little is left to flow out of the valley. A path
to Nubra follows a side valley on the right. In Sakti
we wander in a labyrinth of narrow passages and alleys
between huts and <i>chhortens</i>, boulders and walls, <i>mani
ringmos</i> and terraces which support cultivated patches laid
out in horizontal steps. Above us is seen the Chang-la,
and we are quite giddy at the sight of the road that ascends
to it with a tremendously steep gradient (Illustration 42).</p>

<p>Tagar is the last village before the pass; here I had
halted twice before. Its wheat-fields extend a little distance
further up the valley and then contract to a wedge-shaped
point, continued by a narrow winding strip of grass along
the central channel of the valley bottom. The sections
of the caravan climb higher and higher, some are already
at the goal, and we have overtaken the hindermost. The
path runs up steeply between huge blocks of grey granite,
so that our Ladakis have to take care that the boxes do not
get banged.</p>

<p>After four-and-a-half hours we are up on the small
terrace-shaped halting-place, Singrul, and the bluish-grey
smoke of the fires of yak dung floats over the soil, scantily
carpeted with grass and traversed by a rivulet of crystal
clear water. An alpine, cold, barren landscape surrounds
us. Muhamed Isa sits enthroned like a pasha in his fortress
of boxes and provender sacks, the usual sheep is killed and
cut up, and is then thrown into the general cauldron,
stomach, entrails, and everything. The head and feet are
broiled before the fire on stones. Some of the men take
possession of the skin, and spend the evening in rubbing
it and making it soft&mdash;probably it is for use as bed furniture.</p>

<p>The two Rajputs sit a little apart from the rest by their
own small cooking-pot, and, I perceive, make a very light
meal of spinach, bread, and rice. The rarefied air seems
to be of no consequence to them, nor the cold; the puppies,
on the other hand, were very down-hearted when the thermometer
in the evening marked only 45°; they howled
piteously, and, crawling under my tent bed, rolled themselves
up together. The four coolies, who carried the
boat, went beyond Singrul to a cave, where, they said,
they would be more protected from the cold in the night.
Towards evening the brook rose, and one of its arms made
straight for my tent, which had to be protected by a temporary
dam. The Ladakis sat till late and sipped their
red tea mixed with butter, and at many points reddish-yellow
fires illumined the night.</p>

<p>The temperature fell to 21°, and it was really very
uncomfortable in this high, raw region where the wind had
free play and the sun had not yet got the better of the
snow; rather large snowdrifts still lay on the ground, and
clear streamlets trickled down from their edges, juicy moss
and grass sprouting up beside them and forming a fine
grass lawn. Accustomed to the heat of India, we feel the
cold particularly severe on rising, when the snow particles
beat like grains of sugar against the tent. A bluish-black
raven sits on a stone, sometimes flying down to examine
what we have left, snaps his beak loudly, and seems contented
with his morning&rsquo;s catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span></p>

<p>Slowly and heavily the horses and mules zigzag up
through the grey granitic detritus and round the boulders
on the way. Our troop is considerably strengthened, for
the animals need help on the acclivities and the loads easily
get out of place. To climb up these heights with loads
on their backs, as our coolies do, they must have especially
constructed lungs, good chests, and strong hearts. We
mount higher and higher to the pass in the mighty range
which separates the Indus from its great affluent, the
Shyok. We still see the green fields down below at the
bottom of the valley, the bird&rsquo;s-eye view becomes more
and more like a map, and the landscape behind us grows
more distinct and extensive. Sharply marked orographical
lines indicate the direction of the Indus valley, and the
great range on its farther side rises darkly before us and
covered with snow. Fifty mules from Rudok laden with
salt threaten to block our way, but are driven to one side
by our men. From time to time we call a halt to allow
our animals to recover their wind. Then we go on a little
farther; the rests become more frequent; the horses puff
and pant and distend their nostrils. And then on again
to the next halt.</p>

<p>At last we were at the top, 17,585 feet above sea-level.
Certainly the thermometer marked 41.4°, but the wind was
in the north, thick clouds obscured the sky, sweeping over
the crest of the mountains, and soon hail came down, slashing
us like a whip. On the summit of the Chang-la
Pass stands a stone heap with sacrificial poles, which are
decked with ragged streamers torn by the wind. All these
streamers bear in Tibetan characters the prayer of the six
sacred letters; coloured or faded, they flap and rustle in
the wind as if they would drive the prayers up higher and
higher by unknown paths to the ears of the gods. Horns
and skulls adorn this elevated altar. Here all our Ladakis
in turn come to a halt, raise a cheer, dance, swing their
caps, and rejoice at having reached this critical point
without mishap.</p>

<p>The descent, however, on the eastern side of the pass,
is still worse: nothing but detritus, boulders of all sizes,
sharp-edged pieces of granite, and between a muddy paste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
in which our horses flop and splash at every step. Sometimes
the path is more like a rough staircase, where you
might fall headlong, but our horses are sure-footed and
accustomed to bad ground. It is cold, dreary, raw, and
grey&mdash;how different from the warm, sunny country we
have so lately left!</p>

<p>At the foot of the descent from the actual pass old
Hiraman, a friend of mine on former journeys, was waiting.
The old man was just the same, perhaps a little more
wrinkled than before (Illustration 45).</p>

<p>After a night with 12.8 degrees of frost we rode on from
Sultak by a small lake dammed up by moraines, and down
a valley full of detritus. Now the puppies had to run alone,
and they did the short day&rsquo;s march without complaining, but
they were heartily sorry for their exhibition of strength when
we got to Drugub, and were so tired out that they omitted
to ferret about as usual (Illustrations 43, 44).</p>

<p>Drugub lies at a height of 12,795 feet, and on the
short way to Tankse we ascended only 299 feet; from
there, however, the route again ascends slowly until at
length one reaches the great open plateau, where the
differences of elevation show little alteration in a month
of marching. Beyond Tankse a massive, finely sculptured
mountain rises in the background; deep valleys open on
either side; through the southern runs a road to Gartok,
which I was to follow later; through the northern, the
road to Muglib, which I had travelled by before; this I
was to take now, and for two days keep to roads I was well
acquainted with.</p>

<p>The Tankse river has a fair volume of water; we
crossed it at a broad, shallow place, where the fall is very
slight. The water is almost quite clear, of a bluish-green
tinge, and glides noiselessly as oil over its gravelly bed.
The whole village was on foot, and watched the pitching
of my tent in a small clump of willows, which had resolutely
struggled against the elevated situation and severe climate.
These, however, were the last trees, worthy the name, that
we saw for half a year.</p>

<p>We rested a day in Tankse, and settled with the men
who were waiting with their thirty hired horses. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
early marches one gains all kinds of experience, and now
we had to make one or two alterations. Muhamed Isa set
up for the caravan men a large Tibetan tent with a broad
opening in the roof to let out the smoke. The sacks of
provender were to form round the inside a protection
against the wind, and at the same time be themselves
sheltered from rain. Furthermore, roasted meal, spices,
and tobacco were purchased for the men, and all the barley
that could be procured in the neighbourhood. The headmen
of Tankse and Pobrang offered to accompany us for
some days on a pleasure trip, and to see that everything
went on smoothly.</p>

<p>Late in the evening a bright fire in Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s
camp lighted up the surroundings, and the noisy music
sounded more merrily than ever. The caravan men held
a jollification on taking leave of civilization, and had invited
the notables of the village and the dancing-girls to tea and
music. It was a very jovial party; the barley beer, <i>chang</i>,
Ladak&rsquo;s national drink, raised the spirits of guests and
hosts, and as I went to sleep I heard female voices and
the notes of flutes and bagpipes echoed back from the
mountain flanks.</p>

<p>On August 21 we were again on the move; at our
departure all Tankse turned out, besides the natives who
had come in from the surrounding villages, and all sent us
off with friendly cries of &ldquo;Jole&rdquo; and &ldquo;A good journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here I commenced to draw my first map-sheet, being
the first stroke of a work that for more than two years kept
my attention riveted on every mile of the route and on
every object that could be seen from it. At the same time
the collections of rock specimens was begun. Specimen
No. 1 was of crystalline schists <i>in situ</i>, while the bottom
of the valley was still covered with large and small blocks
of granite.</p>

<p>We left the Tankse monastery on its rocky spur to our
left, and henceforth kept to the right side of the Muglib
brook, now at the foot of the mountain and past its cones
of detritus, now over easily recognizable denudation terraces,
and again along the bank of the brook, where here and there
we came across a miniature meadow. Down in the valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
at Muglib there is good rich pasture; close by the brook
the meadows are swampy and treacherous, but higher up
the soil is sandy, and even thistles crop up among the
grass.</p>

<p>Here our 130 animals grazed and were hurriedly
inspected. Sonam Tsering had to give a report of his
stewardship, which he had managed admirably, and our
mules looked fat and plump after grazing for five days on
the open pastures of Muglib. Our camp was now for the
first time fully mustered, and with its four tents and its
various groups of men seated round, the camp-fires had a
very imposing appearance. Horses neigh and mules bray
on all sides, the men remove the pack-saddles to see that
the under side is smooth and cannot rub and cause sores,
the animals are groomed and fed, their hoofs are examined
and re-shod, if the old shoes are worn out on the stony
ground.</p>

<p>The village of Muglib consists of three wretched huts,
and its twelve inhabitants cultivate barley and peas. The
barley harvest was expected in ten days, but the peas were
still in full blossom, and would not be ripe before the frosts
set in. They are then used as horse fodder while they are
still soft and green. I asked some Muglib men what they
did in winter. &ldquo;Sleep and freeze,&rdquo; they answered.</p>

<p>Next morning the sun had not risen when a shouting
and jingling, loud voices, and the stamping and neighing
of horses woke me out of sleep&mdash;the heavy cavalry was
marching off under the command of Muhamed Isa. Then
the puppies discovered that my bed was a grand playground,
and left me no more peace. Manuel&rsquo;s fire in the kitchen
began to crackle, and a fragrant steam gave notice that
there were mutton cutlets for breakfast. I was accustomed
to camp life, but I had never been so comfortable before
and had never had so large and perfect a caravan.</p>

<p>Beyond the village we crossed the brook six times; it
is quite small, and seems always to contain the same amount
of water, for it comes from a small lake, where I had
encamped on the eastern shore in December 1901. Now
we followed the northern shore over many very difficult
mountain spurs of black schist and quartzite; the ground is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
covered with gravel, sometimes with small patches of coarse
grass, and then again is very sandy. Sometimes torrents
of clear water gush down from the mountains, where huge
fan-shaped cones of dejection descend from the mouths of
ravines to the valley.</p>

<p>A heap of stones bedecked with flags and a <i>mani</i> mark
the point of hydrographical importance, which is the watershed
between the Panggong-tso and the Indian Ocean;
here the height is 14,196 feet. From this point the valley
descends slowly to the lake, and we ride in the channel
through which at one time it discharged itself into the
Shyok and Indus.</p>

<p>Now, the Panggong-tso is cut off from the Indus and
consequently contains salt water. Behind a spur on the
right side of the valley which hides the view, the western
extremity of the lake peeped out, and a few minutes later a
grand panorama unfolded itself before us; the great bluish-green
lake between its colossal cliffs. Five years before I
had skirted its northern shore with my camels, my old
sturdy veterans, which caused so much excitement in Ladak
that there I was still called the Camel Lord.</p>

<p>Just where the Pobrang river enters, forming a flat
delta full of lagoons, we halted for a while to control our
determination of heights by a boiling-point observation,
and then rode along the river, which in 1901 was choked
up with drifted sand, but was now full of water. When
the drainage water fails in winter, the bed is at once filled
up with sand, but the dunes are swept away again as soon
as the spring flood sets in.</p>

<p>Lukkong is a small village with a couple of stone huts,
a field of barley, a <i>chhorten</i>, a meadow, and a stunted
mountain poplar. From this place the road runs north
and north-east through the broad pebble-strewn valley,
where we have a foretaste of the flatter conformation of
the Tibetan plateau. We are in a region which has no
drainage to the sea; we have already crossed three important
thresholds, the Zoji-la, the Chang-la, and, to-day, the
small Panggong Pass, but we have still two great passes in
front of us before we finally enter the wide expanses of the
tableland. Beyond the first we must again descend to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
basin of the Indus, behind the second lies an enclosed
hydrographical area which we must traverse in order to
reach the country draining to the ocean through the upper
valleys of the Brahmaputra.</p>

<p>From a small pass with a few stone cairns we had a
surprising view over a valley which ran parallel to the
one we had just travelled through, and was full of green
meadows. Many tents and camp-fires were seen above
and below the village Pobrang, and the meadow land was
dotted over with dark caravan animals, for mine was not
the only party that was paying Pobrang a flying visit: an
English <i>shikari</i>, too, was there, a Mr. Lucas Tooth, who
had been hunting in the mountains and was very well
pleased with his collection of antelope horns. We talked
in my tent till midnight, and he was the last European I
saw for a space of more than two years.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER VI</p>

<p class="center chap2">TO THE EDGE OF THE TIBETAN TABLELAND</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">We</span> had another day&rsquo;s rest in Pobrang; there we found the
last good pasture land on the way to Tibet; it was, moreover,
important that men and horses should gradually
become accustomed to the increasing elevation. I had also
received my letters from Sweden and India, and was a long
time occupied with my letters and answers; the post-carrier
was to return to Leh on the next day. But it was arranged
that a mail-runner should be sent after us from there. From
Pobrang he was to have a companion, for the country is
infested with wolves. After the road came to an end the
track of the caravan could easily be traced, and it was
agreed that we should pile up small heaps of stones at
doubtful points for the guidance of the letter-carriers. However,
we never heard anything of them, and I do not know
how they prospered. Pobrang, then, was the last point
where I was in contact with the outer world.</p>

<p>Here we bought thirty sheep for fresh meat; we thought
we should not want more, as the chase would yield us some
supply, and some of my men were clever sportsmen.</p>

<p>At Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s suggestion, Sonam Tsering&rsquo;s pay
was raised to 20 rupees, and he was appointed caravan-bashi
of the mules. Old Guffaru was leader of the horse
caravan, and Tsering, the short name we gave to Muhamed
Isa&rsquo;s brother, had the management of the small caravan
which transported my daily necessaries, Robert&rsquo;s tent, and
the cooking outfit.</p>

<p>The <i>jamadar</i>, Rahman Khan, who had been my leader
in 1902, and had come with us from Lamayuru, was discharged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
and well paid, and also the two <i>chaprassis</i>, Razul
and Ishe. Old Hiraman insisted on keeping us company
for another day&rsquo;s journey, while the <i>Numberdar</i> of Pobrang
and the <i>Kotidar</i> of Tankse were to remain with us, as
already mentioned, up to the plateau. Thus our party was
gradually lessened; last of all the hired horses and their ten
attendants would leave us.</p>

<p>I consulted every evening with Muhamed Isa; Robert,
too, was generally present, for he was the first of all my
servants, conducted the business of the caravan, and kept
accounts of the expenditure. We now resolved that some
of the hired yaks should carry the boat, and that the last of
the coolies should turn back. Then we took stock of our
provisions: the maize and barley must last for 68 days; the
meal for our thirty men would hold out for 80 days, and
with economy for three months; the rice would not be all
consumed for four or five months. But, however carefully
calculations and estimates may be made, it is a risky, adventurous
undertaking to cross the whole of Tibet, and the
calculations seldom turn out correct. One may be sure of
losing animals wholesale; matters may, too, come to a crisis,
when the loads become too heavy for the surviving animals,
and part of the baggage must be sacrificed. It may also
happen that the provender diminishes more quickly than
the animals, and then the latter must put up with smaller
feeds, and at last find what nourishment they can on the
ground.</p>

<p>My chief anxiety now was to maintain the caravan until
we might meet the first nomads to the north of Bogtsang-tsangpo;
had we good fortune so far, we should manage to
get on by some means or other. I now drew up a provisional
plan of campaign, the chief point being that it was
based, not on time and distances, but on pasturage and
water. The length of a day&rsquo;s march was, then, fixed by the
occurrence of these indispensable resources, and even a
march of one hour in the day was enough when it led to
tolerable pasture. Where, however, the land was quite
barren we might travel any distance we liked. No one had
any suspicion of my actual plans; I meant to reveal all only
when the last men and their horses had left us. If I let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
anything transpire now, my plan would be made known in
Ladak, and would reach the ears of my opponents. Then,
as so often before, a merciless &ldquo;Thus far and no farther&rdquo;
would have sounded in my ears even at Bogtsang-tsangpo.</p>

<p>On August 24 we left Pobrang, the last village, and rode
up the valley. Fine tame yaks were sunning themselves
on small grassy patches. To the left stretches out the
Ldata valley, with good pasture lands in its lower part.
Seen from a flat hilly rise with a couple of stone cairns, the
country to the east assumes more of a Tibetan character,
with low, rounded forms, and small, slightly marked open
valleys and dried-up river beds. Everything seems dreary
and barren; small hard <i>yapkak</i> plants are alone visible.
The ascent is extremely slow, but the path is still easily
perceptible in the tiring gravel or sand. Not a drop of water
is to be seen. The weather is quite Tibetan: burning hot
when the atmosphere is calm and clear; raw and cold when
the sun is overcast, and the wind envelops horse and rider
in sand.</p>

<p>At Lunkar we encamped near some deserted stone
huts. A couple of hundred yards from us were grazing a
pair of <i>kulans</i> or <i>kiangs</i>, as the wild asses are called in Tibet
and Ladak. Nine fires lighted up the darkness, and snow
hissed among the firebrands, continuing to fall, so the night
watchman reported, till early morning.</p>

<p>Consequently in the morning was heard the crunching
sound caused by footfalls on frozen snow; my tent bulged
inwards under the burden, while all the landscape disappeared
under a white wintry mantle, and dense clouds hung
over all the crests. Manuel and Ganpat Sing had never
seen snow falling before; they appeared extremely astonished
and curious, and looked very cold in their <i>pustins</i> or
Yarkand fur coats. The puppies were highly displeased
at this new occurrence, and barked at the snow in their
disgust till they found that it was no use. They also disapproved
of our impudence in adding two large dogs from
Pobrang to the caravan. Another reinforcement consisted
of ten goats to supply me with milk, which were obtained
in Lunkar.</p>

<p>We were all of a sudden transferred from the summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
that reigned in Tankse to midwinter on the heights, and
received a foretaste of the cold of the neighbouring Tibet.
We saw little more of the summer this year&mdash;Pamzel might
allow us to take a last farewell of the warm season.</p>

<p>The main caravan was still there when I left my tent,
and we started all together. Old Hiraman took leave of
us, and rode back down to his hut. The sun came out, and
all around became dazzling white; even the Ladakis were
forced to protect their eyes with a tuft of wool, which they
fixed in front under their caps, and they looked very comical
with this by no means becoming frontal decoration.</p>

<p>The long train now wound up to the pass like a huge
black snake. The forty sheep and goats with their drivers
led the way, but were soon overtaken by the mules, which
now marched all day at the front. Next came Muhamed
Isa with the horse caravan, and at his heels the hired
horses with their leaders, and the yaks belonging to them.
In their tracks followed our seven hired yaks, which carried
the heaviest boxes and the boat; they did their work very
well, and were first-rate animals&mdash;great black beasts; they
did not seem to be affected by the high elevation of the
pass, nor to feel the weight of the boxes; and kept up with
the rear of the caravan all day long. Behind the yaks I
rode, with Robert, the <i>Kotidar</i> of Tankse, and a runner
who held my horse when I dismounted to search for rock
specimens, take bearings, or make sketches. Last of all came
Tsering and Manuel with my small caravan (Illustration 47).</p>

<p>We had not ridden far when we came up with the horse
entered as number 52 on the list; it came from Sanskar,
and cost 90 rupees. It had eaten nothing the day before,
and was evidently on its last legs, for its leader could
only make it stumble on a step at a time. It bled from the
nostrils, its belly was swollen, and its muzzle was cold&mdash;all
bad symptoms. It seemed to suffer from giddiness, and at
last fell down and could not be induced to get up again.
After a time, however, it raised itself up with a last effort,
but rolled over again on the other side. We saw it from
the pass still lying motionless, its attendant beside it; the
latter overtook us later and reported that there was nothing
to be done with the horse. So it was numbered 1 in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
list of the lost, and we decided that the <i>Kotidar</i> might keep
it, should it unexpectedly recover.</p>

<p>This pass, the Marsimik-la, had looked quite easy from
our camping-ground at Lunkar, but now we found that it
would be a very serious matter to cross it. The horses
had to stop and recover their wind every five minutes at
first, then every minute and a half, and at last they could
not go more than a minute at a time, and then must stand
still for as long. The snow now lay a foot deep, and the
caravan marked out a coal-black winding line through the
white expanse. Curious yellowish-grey and violet clouds
rose above the mighty snowy range to the south and west.
When the sun was visible our faces and hands were
scorched; but when it was hidden behind clouds the day
was pleasant, and the glitter of the sunshine on the snow,
so trying to the eyes, was extinguished by the shadows of
the clouds.</p>

<p>The caravan in front of us seems hardly to move, so
slow is the progress in this highly rarefied air. Still it does
move onwards, as we can tell by the constant shouts
of the drivers. Some of the Ladakis sing together to
lighten the toil of themselves and the animals. They are
as cheerful and contented as though they were going to a
harvest festival. From time to time Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s voice
growls forth like rolls of thunder, shouting out <i>Khavass</i> and
<i>Khabardar</i>. We see him standing up above at the last
turn up to the pass, and hear him distributing his orders from
the centre of the semicircle now formed by the caravan.
His sharp, practised eye takes in every horse; if a load
threatens to slip down he calls up the nearest man; if
there is any crowding, or a gap in the ranks, he notices it
immediately. With his hands in his pockets and his pipe
in his mouth he goes up quietly on foot over the
Marsimik-la.</p>

<p>Now the first column of mules reaches the ridge of the
pass. A joyous shout goes out over the mountains; it is
heard clearly and distinctly, but is indescribably thin, cold,
and toneless, and at once dies away without awaking the
feeblest echo; the air is too rare for that. Every detachment
as it comes to the pass raises the same shout of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
triumph. With a feeling of relief I watch the last horse
disappear below the white outline of the pass summit.</p>

<p>At the highest point I made, as usual, a fairly long halt
to take observations, while Tsering&rsquo;s detachment filed past
me, and the yaks tramped, grunting, over the Marsimik-la.
The absolute height was 18,343 feet, the sky was partly
clear, and it was as warm as in an oven, though the temperature
had risen only to 34.7°. Before we began to move
again the tail of the procession had vanished behind the
point of rock which marks the entrance to the valley that
leads downwards. The fallen horse lay lonely and forlorn,
a dark spot in the snow. It was the offering the gods of the
pass had exacted as toll.</p>

<p>Eastwards the high range appears more uniform, as
though planed down, and no prominent summit rises above
the crest. The descent from the pass is bestrewn with
pebbles and small blocks, which may be said to swim in
mud. The snow thaws, and a continual trickling murmuring
sound is heard. The route of the caravan is marked
by an endless succession of small deep ditches filled with
water, and meandering in dark lines through the white
surface. Numerous trickles of water collect into a rivulet,
which rushes down among the stones. Where the ground
is level a swamp is formed, dome-shaped clumps of moss
render it uneven, and between these stand pools, often of
deceptive depth. For a long distance we follow a perfectly
bare slope, and we are almost impatient at descending so
slowly to the layers of denser air.</p>

<p>At length we go down steeply into the valley over a disagreeable
slope of detritus crossed by a number of small
water channels. On the left opens a large trough-shaped
valley, where we can perceive in the upper part three snow-covered
glacier tongues with fissures in the ice-front standing
out clearly. From these a large brook issues, which
unites with the brook from the pass into a greenish-grey
foaming river. From their confluence we see the whole
length of the valley which we must traverse to reach our
camping-ground. It is deeply and boldly eroded; the
foaming river occupies the whole of its bottom. We must
therefore keep to the steep banks on the right side, 300
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
to 600 feet above the river. Here the ground is detestable&mdash;coarse,
sharp pebbles forming the edge of a terrace&mdash;and
as we have to ride along the outer edge we should
roll down the slope and break our necks if the horses
made a false step.</p>

<p>Here one of the Pobrang dogs came towards us; he
made a wide detour to avoid us, and did not once look
at us when we tried to coax him. Probably he suspected
that we were on the way to inhospitable regions,
and thought he could lead a more peaceful life at the
miserable huts of Pobrang. At length we came down
over swampy moss-grown rubbish mounds to the camp,
which was situated just where our valley ran at an angle
into the Spanglung valley, in the midst of lofty mountains
where nothing could be heard but the monotonous roar of
the two streams. Wearied out, we threw ourselves into
our tents and enjoyed the pleasant heat of the brazier.
Bikom Sing went up the mountains and shot at an antelope,
but missed. Muhamed Isa said jestingly that hitherto
the Rajputs had done no more than the puppies. He did
not include them at all in our muster roll; in his opinion
they did nothing but consume our stores of meal and rice;
but he was unjust in condemning them before they had had an
opportunity of distinguishing themselves (Illustrations 48, 49).</p>

<p>The moon shone, a cold pale sickle, over the mountains,
and we were glad to get to rest; after such a day the night
comes as a friend and deliverer.</p>

<p>Our route to Pamzal continued downwards along the
Spanglung valley, sometimes about 150 feet above the
bottom, where some snowdrifts resisted the warmth of the
short summer, sometimes on sharply defined terraces
forming several steps. The road was bad, for the whole
country was full of detritus. On the right opened the
Lungnak valley with small snowy peaks in the background,
and before us towered the great dark range lying on the north
side of the Chang-chenmo valley. The Manlung valley
runs up from the south-west, and its stream contributes
a large addition of muddy water to our valley.</p>

<p>As we advanced farther, other grand snowy mountains
and jagged peaks came into view&mdash;these are the heights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
that enclose the Chang-chenmo valley. At last the path
turned into this valley, and we bivouacked on the small strip
of vegetation on the left bank of the river (Illustration 50).</p>

<p>Towards evening the river rose considerably; when we
measured its volume next morning we found the discharge
to be 494 cubic feet a second, and large strips of the stony
bed were still wet from the high-water in the night. In
summer one cannot ride through the river at this place;
then it rolls enormous floods down to the Indus. Its name
is Kograng-sanspo, while Chang-chenmo denotes rather
the whole country around. The Ladakis said that the
summer would here last twenty days longer; after that the
nights would become cold but the days remain fairly warm;
then, however, winter would come with ever-increasing
rigour.</p>

<p>Eastwards five days&rsquo; march brings one to the pass
Lanak-la, which belongs to the colossal ridge of the
Karakorum mountains running right through Tibet. Some
English travellers have crossed this pass. To me the
road was closed. I had promised Lord Minto not to act
against the wishes of the English Government, but I should
like to know who could have prevented me now.</p>

<p>On August 28 we left this pleasant, quiet spot, and now
it would be long before we came again to so low a level.
We were constantly increasing the distance from roads and
human dwellings; for some time yet we were to remain
in known country, and then the vast unknown land in the
east awaited us. The day was fair and warm when I set
out with my usual companions, Robert, Rehim Ali, one of
our Mohammedans, and the two drivers from Tankse and
Pobrang.</p>

<p>The terrace on the left bank, on which we ride, is
washed by a branch of the stream which is very muddy,
forms small rapids, and usually divides into several arms.
The whole of the valley bottom is grey with rubbish; the
river water has much the same colour, and therefore is not
conspicuous in the landscape. There is no living thing
anywhere around, neither tame yaks nor wild animals, and
not a sign of men. But a faintly beaten footpath shows
that mountaineers occasionally wander here. It guides us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
down to the river again, at a point opposite the narrow,
deep, and boldly sculptured transverse valley Kadsung with
the usual terraces, from which emerges a brook of clear,
blue, beautifully fresh water and mingles with, and is lost in,
the dirty grey water of the main stream. Here the path
again turns upwards and affords a short cut over a small
pass to our camp for the night. We could see at a distance
that in the middle of the steep slope where the path runs
there had been a landslip, and a deep fissure formed which
we could hardly cross until some alterations had been
effected. A troop of men were sent in advance with
spades and pick-axes, and meanwhile the various sections
of the caravan collected together on the bank.</p>

<p>Some men examined the ford on foot, for here we had
to cross the main stream. The water certainly foamed up
to the houghs of the horses as they were led over in long
files, but the depth was nowhere more than 2½ feet, and all
came safely to the other bank. The yaks evidently liked
the bath; they waded through the water as slowly as possible,
and my boat was poised over its own element without
touching it. The most difficult task was to get the
sheep and goats over. The whole flock was driven to the
water&rsquo;s edge, and some were seized by the horns and thrown
into the river, though they struggled frantically. But the
rest found the situation too disagreeable, turned tail and
made a wild dash up the nearest terrace. Again they were
all driven to the bank, and were there shut in by a line of
men and pushed into the water, and as the first had now
made up their minds to wade, the others followed and
bravely struggled against the current (Illustrations 51, 52).</p>

<p>Immediately after, the caravan was seen labouring up
the steep slope; it was a pretty sight, but not without
danger. The sheep did not keep to the path, but climbed
about in search of food.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">52. <span class="sc">Muhamed Isa in the River Chang-chenmo near Pamzal.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>A couple of minutes after the little pass Mankogh-la is
left behind there is a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the valley of the
Kograng-sanspol, at any rate of the upper part, which we
had followed from Pamzal; it makes here a sharp turn, and
we came over hills and spurs down again to the river-bank.
The camping-ground, which has fairly good pasturage, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
called Gogra. From here two valleys run up to the main
crest of the Karakorum range, the Chang-lung-barma and
the Chang-lung-yogma or &ldquo;the middle and the lower north
valleys.&rdquo; Both valleys would take us to a nasty pass; we
chose the second. We must get over somehow or other,
and at dangerous places the most valuable baggage could,
if necessary, be carried by men. With his cap on the side
of his head, his fur coat thrown negligently over his
shoulders, and the inevitable pipe in his mouth, Muhamed
Isa stalked like a field-marshal through the smoke of the
camp-fires and issued his orders for the next day&rsquo;s march.
None of our men, indeed, knew the road, but from their
uncertain reports we could gather that we had a nasty bit
of work before us.</p>

<p>We did not reach a much greater height during our
march, but we had to go up and down over so many hills
and steep declivities that the day&rsquo;s journey was as trying
as though we had surmounted a number of passes. The
river was now considerably smaller, as many of its tributaries
had been left behind. Nevertheless, it was more
troublesome to ford than before, for the whole volume of
water was confined to one channel, and the fall was greater.
It seemed hopeless to drive the sheep into the cold water
where the current would carry them away. The shepherds
were at a loss what to do when I lost sight of them, and I
do not know how the passage was accomplished; but they
came across somehow, for they reached the camp all safe
and sound. The dark-green schists in this neighbourhood
are partly much weathered, partly hard and untouched. A
large cairn stands on a hill, and one of the men asserted
that an old road to Yarkand ran past here, while Guffaru
affirmed that some, at least, of Forsyth&rsquo;s companions travelled
through this country.</p>

<p>The headwaters of the river flow from a large valley
to the north-west, its background formed by snow mountains,
while we follow the heights above a side valley,
which, seen from above, has a grand and almost awesome
aspect. A small, clear brook murmurs melodiously along
the bottom. Then again we descend over soft red dust and
rubbish. Small cairns mark the route, and guide us down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
to the bottom of the valley, here very narrow, and confined
between steep, dark schistose rocks. A little higher up the
rocky walls are perpendicular, and the river finds its way
through a dark gorge. We therefore have to climb up
the right side to avoid the difficult spots, and the ascent
is very steep. Here the caravan came to a standstill;
Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s gigantic form was seen at the worst point
of the ascent. Every horse had to be assisted up by five
men. One tugged at the bridle, two supported the load at
either side to prevent it slipping off, and two pushed
behind; as soon as somewhat easier ground was reached
the baggage was put to rights and the cords tightened,
and then the horse had to get along the track without
help.</p>

<p>In the Chuta district, where we again find ourselves at
the valley bottom, warm springs of sulphurous water rise
out of the earth. One of them has built up a pyramid 10
feet high, somewhat like a toad-stool; the water bubbles up
from the centre of the crown, and drops down the sides,
forming a circle of stalactites around. The water as it
leaves the orifice has a temperature of 124° F. Another
spring, which sends a jet of water right into the river, has
a heat of only 108°. At many places on the bank and in
the river-bed the water bubbles up with a simmering noise.</p>

<p>After more rugged slopes of rubbish and loose yellow
dust we arrived at last in the Chang-lung-yogma valley,
where the pasturage was very scanty. In the evening it
snowed hard, and the valley was veiled in a mystic light,
which was perhaps a faint reflexion of the moon. A couple
of fires flashed out of the mist and lighted up the large
tent of the Ladakis. Only the murmur of the brook
broke the silence. Suddenly, however, repeated shouts
resounded through the stillness of the night&mdash;perhaps some
horses had taken into their heads to stampede to more
hospitable regions.</p>

<p>We needed a day&rsquo;s rest in this camp, for before us was
the high pass which forms a watershed between the Indus
and the isolated drainage of the plateau. Muhamed Isa
and Sonam Tsering rode up the valley to reconnoitre, and,
meanwhile, Robert and I repacked my boxes amidst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
alternations of sunshine and snowfalls; winter clothing
and furs were taken out, and the tent bed was put aside;
henceforth my bed was to be made on the ground, on a foundation
consisting of a waterproof sheet and a frieze rug;
by this method it is much easier to get warm.</p>

<p>On the last day of August the ascent was continued.
The country was white with snow, but before noon the
ground was clear again. I now rode a small, white, active
Ladak pony; it was sure-footed, and we were soon good
friends. A small stone wall at a bend of the route shows
that men have been here; but many years have probably
elapsed since their visit, for there is no sign of a path or
other indications of their presence. All is barren, yet it is
evident that wild yaks have been here not long ago.
Muhamed Isa set up three cairns at the mouth of a very
small insignificant side-valley for the guidance of the expected
post-runners. Here we turned aside from the main
valley. The contours of the mountains now become more
rounded, the relative heights diminish, and the valleys are
not so deeply excavated as on yesterday&rsquo;s ride. The rivulet,
which we follow up to its source in the main ridge, is
the last connected with the system of the Indus, but still it
is a child of the Indus, and carries to the sea news of this
elevated region. Winter will soon chain up its waters,
soon it will fall asleep in the cold and frost, until the sun
calls it to life again in spring (Illustration 55).</p>

<p>An old yak skull was set up on a rocky projection and
grinned at us&mdash;another of Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s waymarks.
There were several <i>yapkak</i> plants, hard as wood, in a small
hollow, but even this meagre forage was no longer to be
despised. We therefore pitched our camp here at a height
of 16,962 feet, or about 1300 feet higher than Mont Blanc.
This camp was distinguished as No. 1, for we were now in a
country beyond the range of topographical names. A huge
stone pyramid was erected among the tents, for the men had
nothing else to do while the animals were gnawing at the
<i>yapkak</i> stalks close by.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">We</span> had a hard day on September 1. The ground was
white, and the sky had a threatening aspect, but a small
blue strip to the south gave hopes of fine weather. We
started early, and as I jumped into the saddle I saw the
whole narrow valley filled with the various sections of the
caravan. When I consigned my tent to its fate, that is,
Tsering and the Hindus, our deserted camp-fires were still
smoking, and the new cairn stood out black against the
snow. We left camp No. 1 with some excitement, for now
we were approaching wild lands in real earnest, and were
to cross a pass of the first rank, which none of my people
was acquainted with, and of which we knew only that it
was called Chang-lung-yogma; it lies a little east of the
pass marked on the large English map of north-east Ladak,
and, as far as I know, no European has yet made use of it.</p>

<p>The terraces along the river bank gradually come to an
end, and, where they do occur, they are only a couple of
yards high, and disturbed by frequent landslips. Our route
runs to the north-east. In front of us appears a pure white
saddle, now flooded with sunshine; we take it for the pass;
but no, the mules, as shown by their tracks in the snow,
have turned in another direction.</p>

<p>The flanks on both sides consist of loose, extremely fine
material, wet and crossed by clefts a foot deep. At the
edge of some spurs these clefts run like the curved fissures
of a glacier tongue. The ground is unstable; the slopes
slip down and are displaced by their own weight, for they
are soaked through, and there are no roots to hold the fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
material; they are in a state of motion, and the gently
rounded forms prevailing in the landscape are the result of
this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The silence of the desert reigns in this country where
the feet of man have never wandered; only now and then
are heard the warning shouts of the caravan men. Not
one of the animals is left behind, all goes on satisfactorily.
May all this hard day&rsquo;s march pass fortunately! The
valley becomes quite narrow, the water trickles out of the
gravelly soil in quantities barely sufficient to form a brook.
But even on this gravel the animals sink in the mud.</p>

<p>At the foot of a trough leading up to a side-pass, which
had led us astray, the caravan came to a halt, and an accessible
passage was searched for.</p>

<p>I rode forwards up innumerable zigzags, and stopped at
every corner to take breath. Muhamed Isa reported that
the true pass had been found, but I rode with Robert up to
a height rising above all the land around, to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The view from this point was far too striking to be
sought merely for the purpose of orientation. Above and
behind the mountains in the foreground, some of them coal-black,
appeared a white horizon and a jagged line of mighty
Himalayan peaks. A really magnificent landscape! The
sky was almost clear; only here and there floated a few
white clouds. Down below us lay the small valley through
which we had struggled so laboriously; here it looked
ridiculously small, an insignificant drain in a world of
gigantic mountains. Some detachments of the caravan
were still toiling up the narrow way, and the shouts and
whistles of the men mounted up to us. The horizon was
quite clear, not enveloped in haze, as it frequently was; its
outlines were exceedingly sharply drawn; silver-white,
sun-lighted summits towered up above and behind one
another; generally the fields of eternal snow gleam in blue
tints of varying intensity, now dull and now dark according
to the angle of the slope in relation to the sun&rsquo;s altitude;
now shade and light pass gradually and insensibly into each
other, now they are sharply defined. Here physical laws
work out their perfect complicated scheme, exacting
absolute obedience. On a shelf below us a part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
caravan halts and puffs; the animals appear like black
spots on the snow. Up here the south-west wind enwraps
us in swiftly passing clouds of whirling snowflakes.</p>

<p>All this agitated sea of the highest mountains in the
world seems singularly uniform as the eye passes unhindered
over its crests. You conceive that no summit
rises above a certain maximum height, for before its head
lifts itself above the crowd, wind and weather, denudation,
have worn it down. In this the mountains are like ocean
waves; when these, too, rise in foaming wrath, their undulations,
seen from the ship&rsquo;s deck, are of equal height,
and the horizon is a straight line; and it is just the same
with the small ridges between the furrows thrown up by
the plough, which are all of uniform height; so that the
field seems in the distance quite level.</p>

<p>The horizon seemed to be very far off; nearer heights
broke the sky-line only to the north and north-east, hiding
those behind, and in this direction thick clouds were hanging,
white above and dark and bluish underneath, and lay
like soft cushions on the earth. There was, then, no
suggestion of a plateau, but far in the north a mountain
range seemed to rise right up to heaven. In the north-west
a main crest was plainly visible, starting from our
point of observation, that is, the height on which we stood.
This is the Karakorum range. The whole ridge here took
the form of a rounded back, without solid rock, and intersected
by numerous small valleys, all starting from the
crest, and cutting gradually deeper and deeper into its
flanks. The main ridge winds like a snake over the
highlands, and the erosion valleys diverge on all sides like
the boughs of a tree. Here horizontal lines predominate
in the landscape, but lower down, in the peripheral region,
vertical lines catch the eye, as in the Chang-chenmo lateral
valleys. Down there the scenery is more imposing and
picturesque, up here the surface of the earth appears
rather flat; here is the abode of storms, and their boundless
playground in the long dark winter nights.</p>

<p>Chilled through to the bones we walked down to the
pass gap, where the whole caravan was assembled; here
the height was 18,963 feet, and the temperature 2° above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
freezing-point. The men were too tired to sing, but we
had good reason to be satisfied, for all the animals had
got up safely with their burdens. We slowly descended
along a small valley running northwards. The ground
consisted entirely of mud, in which the animals sank at
every step, and in the footprints they left behind muddy
grey water collected immediately. Round about us lay a
chaos of comparatively low, flat hills, furrowed everywhere
by clefts which indicate landslips. A tiny rivulet winds
silently down the middle of the valley without forming
rapids. For the rest, all the country was flooded, and so
we had no immediate fear of scarcity of water.</p>

<p>Where we encamped not a blade of grass could be
seen; there was, therefore, no object in letting the horses
run about loose, so they were tied together in couples,
and had to stand waiting till the sun went down. Then
Guffaru sat down on a rug, had a sack of maize placed
before him, filled a wooden bowl with the grain, and
emptied it into a nose-bag, which a Ladaki hung on the
muzzle of a horse. And so the men ran about till all the
animals had received their rations, and the dry, hard maize
corns cracked under the teeth of the hungry beasts. The
Ladak horses positively refused to eat maize, and were
given barley instead; they whinnied with delight when
the bags were brought, but the pleasure did not last long;
the chewing gradually ceased, and with lowered heads and
blinking eyes they wearily waited for the long night.</p>

<p>Some spare horses were laden with dry <i>yapkak</i> plants;
at camp No. 2 there was not a particle of fuel. We were
now at a height of 18,215 feet.</p>

<p>In the morning we took leave of Chenmo, the <i>Kotidar</i>
of Tankse, and Zambul, the <i>Numberdar</i> of Pobrang, who
turned back here. They would be able to enjoy warm
winds and bright sunny days again. Besides a liberal
reward for their valuable services they each received a
testimonial in flattering terms. They took my letters with
them, and were to give the messengers instructions about
the route, should they fall in with them. Our party was
thereby diminished by six men, three horses, and seven
yaks (Illustration 46).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span></p>

<p>There were now only three men in my detachment,
namely, myself, Robert on horseback, and Rehim Ali on
foot. We turned with the brook to the north, and had
hilly elevations on both sides. The country was, as it
were, dead&mdash;not a blade of grass, not a track of a strayed
antelope; all organic life seemed to be banished from the
neighbourhood. But when we had advanced a little
further we found signs of the visits of man. A faint light
streak on the ground seemed to be a path which had not
been used for a long time, and beside it stood a cylindrical
cairn surmounted by a slab of stone. At one spot, too,
lay several skulls of horses and yaks; yet hunters, they
say, never wander hither. Perhaps it was a memento of
the cartographical work of the Survey of India, or was
connected with the European pioneers who many years
ago travelled backwards and forwards between Eastern
Turkestan and India.</p>

<p>The weather was quite Tibetan. One shower of hail
after another chilled us through, and drove a cold douche
into our faces, but the sun was always shining somewhere
within sight. Long sheets of hail fell from the clouds,
which seemed of very insignificant volume, but they could
not whiten the ground. It seemed dry as tinder, in contrast
to the wet slopes on either side of the Karakorum
Pass. Dust even rose now and then behind the horses.
Far in front of us we saw two dark points on the yellowish-grey
land&mdash;they were a horse and its guide which had
lingered behind the others.</p>

<p>The long procession of the caravan moved extremely
slowly along the descent. It made a halt, so pasturage
had been found! Ah, no&mdash;the soil was just as barren here
as along the other 12 miles we had travelled this day. So,
as yesterday, the horses had to stand tied together, and the
nose-bags of barley and maize were strapped round their
necks.</p>

<p>In the twilight I summoned Muhamed Isa to a council
of war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long can the animals hold out, if we find no
pasture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two months, sir; but we shall find grass before then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If the marches are no longer than to-day&rsquo;s we shall
take ten days to reach Lake Lighten, which Sahib Wellby
discovered twenty years ago, and the route lies through
Ling-shi-tang and Aksai-chin, which are some of the most
desolate regions in all Tibet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will try to make forced marches, to get
through the bad country as quickly as possible; in the
neighbourhood of Yeshil-kul the grazing is good, according
to Sonam Tsering, who has been there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How goes it with the animals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are in good condition&mdash;only a horse and a mule
are tired out, but we will let them travel awhile without
loads. As for the rest, their loads are a little heavier now
that we no longer have the seven yaks. But that will soon
right itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are the hired horses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all right except two, which are on their last
legs, and which we shall soon lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that the animals are spared as much as possible
and are well cared for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may depend on me, nothing will be neglected.
In camps like this they get more maize and barley than
usual, but where there is pasturage we will be more
sparing of our supplies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On September 3 the level plateau was hidden in
snowdrift and mist, and it was hard to decide in which
direction to proceed: we agreed, however, that none of us
should lose sight of the brook, for apparently no other
water was to be found. We had not gone far when snow
began to fall, a sharp south-west wind arose, and the whirling
snowflakes hid even the nearest hills. It now snowed
so thickly that we were afraid of missing the track of the
caravan, which was far in front of us. According to the
English map we could not be far from a small salt lake,
but in this weather we were unable to obtain any notion of
the lie of the land, and it was no use to climb a hill in
order to look round. We sat in the saddle pelted with
snow, but the snow soon thawed on our clothes, leaving an
unpleasant smell of dampness behind.</p>

<p>But this weather did not last long; the heavy dark blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
and purple clouds parted asunder like curtains, and continued
their rapid course to the east; the view was clear
again. Some scouts, who had gone in advance, discovered
some fine <i>yapkak</i> plants on the left bank of the river, and
our hungry animals were glad to put up with these. Three
antelope tracks we crossed were regarded as a good sign;
there must be pasturage somewhere about, but where?</p>

<p>The next day&rsquo;s march led us over an apparently level
plain, begirt by a ring of mountains, and our direction was
on the whole north-east. We started simultaneously. I
rode all along the caravan, which made a fine show. The
animals did not march in file but in scattered troops, and
their footprints combined to form a broad highway. The
mules keep up bravely, and are always in the van. Several
of the horses are suffering, and lie down from time to
time, only to be roused up immediately by the Ladakis.
Muhamed Isa leads the way on foot; he is the lodestone
which draws after it the whole company.</p>

<p>Now we tried to cross the broad swampy bed of the
stream. Muhamed Isa mounted his horse, but his steed
sank in up to the belly; we had to give up the attempt
and follow the bank instead. At times we had to cross
side channels with the same treacherous ground. When
the pilot had shown the way, some laden mules followed;
then the other animals came all together. They sank up to
the knee in the squelching ooze, and the ground behind
them looked like an indiarubber sponge.</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock the daily storm set in. In the north-west
its outer margin was marked with great sharpness.
It rolled, huge, black, and heavy, over the plateau. Now
the storm is over our heads and its first black fringes
swallow up the blue expanses of the sky. Two ravens,
which have faithfully followed us for some days, croak
hoarsely; a few small birds skim twittering over the
ground. The hail lashes us with terrible violence; it
comes from the side, and the animals turn their tails to
the storm, and thus leave the trail, and have to be driven
again into the right direction. We do not know where we
are going. I halt with Muhamed Isa for a moment&rsquo;s rest
on a hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be better if we filled some goatskin sacks
with water, in case we lose sight of the stream,&rdquo; he
suggests to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, let us go on; it will soon clear up, and then we
can consider the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the train moves on in spite of the drifting snow
and the wintry darkness. It grows light, and the eyes
survey unhindered the dreary, hilly, snow-covered land;
westwards extend the plains of Ling-shi-tang; to the south-east
stretches the immense Karakorum range with peaks
covered with eternal snow, where thunder rolls among
blue-black leaden clouds. Soon this storm also reaches
us, and we are enveloped in dense, fine, dry snowflakes,
while the darkness of night reigns around us. I am
riding at the tail of the train. The caravan is divided
into four columns. We travel in the wake of the last,
which looks almost black through the mist; the one in
front of it appears as a dirty grey patch; the next is hardly
perceptible, and the foremost is almost quite invisible.
Muhamed Isa has vanished. The snow now changes into
large feathery flakes, which sweep almost horizontally over
the ground. All is silent in our company; no one speaks:
the men walk with their bodies bent forward and their fur
caps drawn over their ears. The whole party looks now
like snow men, and the snow makes the loads heavier for
the animals than they need be.</p>

<p>At last our old friend, the brook, peeped out again from
the duskiness, and we pitched our camp on the bank.
Tsering discovered abundance of <i>yapkak</i> plants close at
hand&mdash;some green, to which the animals were led, others
dry, and very acceptable as fuel. In the evening there
were 5½ degrees of frost. The moonlight fell in sheaves
of rays through an atmosphere full of fine snow crystals.
Absolute silence! One can hear the puppies&rsquo; hearts beat,
the ticking of the chronometer, the cold of night descending
and penetrating into the earth.</p>

<p>The country we marched through on September 5
was good and level, especially near a small lake, which
now showed its blue surface in the south-east. Like all
other salt lakes in Tibet it seems to be drying up, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
we travelled for some distance over its dry muddy bed,
and saw, higher up, plainly marked old terraced banks.
Muhamed Isa reported that an exhausted mule would
probably not be able to cross a pass in a small ridge
which barred our way. It managed, however, to get over,
and came into camp in the evening, but was thin and
exhausted. Two Pantholops antelopes, easily distinguishable
by their long, lyre-shaped horns, sped away southwards,
and we came across a wolf&rsquo;s spoor. In some spots
the pasture was so good that we halted a few minutes to
let the animals feed. We were sometimes tempted to
pitch our camp, but yet we passed on. At last we
bivouacked in an expansion of the valley with a stagnant
creek, <i>yapkak</i>, and thin grass. We had scarcely hoped to
find these three things so necessary to us&mdash;pasturage, fuel,
and water, so soon and so close to the Karakorum. In
this camp, No. 6, we decided to give the animals a day&rsquo;s
rest after all their exertions (Illustrations 58 a, 58 b).</p>

<p>On September 7, at daybreak, six miserable jades were
picked out from the hired horses, and, as their loads were
already consumed, were allowed to return home with their
two guides. The sick mule lay dead. The sky was
perfectly cloudless and the day became burning hot. In
another respect we entered on new conditions, for, though
we had covered 19 miles, we had not seen a drop of
water before we reached the place where our camp was
pitched. It seemed not unlikely that the monsoon clouds
would come no more over the Karakorum, and then scarcity
of water might render our situation very critical.</p>

<p>The direction of the march was determined for us by
open country lying between low, round, reddish hills. The
ground would have been excellent if field-mice had not
undermined it, so that the horses continually stepped into
the holes and almost fell on their noses. The mice certainly
did not show themselves, but it was too early in the year
for their winter sleep. The broad valley opened into a
colossal cauldron, skirted on all sides by grand mountains,
a regular <i>Meidan</i>, as the men of Turkestan call such a
valley. To the north the mountains between the Karakash
and Yurungkash lift up their lofty peaks, and in the south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
the Karakorum diverges farther and farther from our
course.</p>

<p>Antelopes career over the plain in light flying leaps;
they stand motionless, watching us, but as soon as we come
near dart off as though on steel springs, and soon vanish
in the distance.</p>

<p>A mountain spur in front of us seemed a suitable point
to make for, where water would surely be found. But
hours passed and it seemed no nearer. A dying horse
detained me; he was relieved of his load, but he was quite
done for. I was very sorry for him, and regretted that he
could not come with us any farther. I stayed awhile to
keep him company, but the day was passing, and the two
men who were with him were ordered to cut his throat if
he could not get on. My Ladakis thought it dreadful to
desert a horse as long as it lived; its death-struggle might
last for hours, and its last moments would be horrible if
wolves got wind of it. It was a tall, black Yarkand horse;
in the evening its number was entered in the list of the
dead.</p>

<p>The caravan was moving in a black line to a ravine
between the hills, where a faint greenish tinge seemed to
indicate grass. A short time after, however, it came down
again and marched out of sight; probably there was no
water there. Another fairly long space of time went by
before we distinguished on the plain westwards small black
spots and lines, whether wild asses or our own mules we
could not determine. The field-glass would not reach so
far. At the foot of a mountain in the west shone a silvery
brook, but it was a long way off, and all distances were so
great that the atmospheric effect misled us, and what we
took for a caravan might be only a shadow on an erosion
terrace.</p>

<p>But Robert&rsquo;s sharp eyes detected the smoke of a signal
fire at the foot of the mountain. The caravan had, then,
reached it and set the camp in order, and after a ride of an
hour straight across the plain we joined it. Here the
height was 16,250 feet.</p>

<p>We were now in a country belonging to the unannexed
region Aksai-chin, in north-west Tibet. Or tell me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
what Power this land belongs? Does the Maharaja of
Kashmir lay claim to it, or the Dalai-Lama, or is it a part
of Chinese Turkestan? No boundaries are marked on the
map, and one looks in vain for boundary stones. The wild
asses, the yaks, and the swift-footed antelopes are subject to
no master, and the winds of heaven do not trouble themselves
about earthly boundary marks. From here, therefore,
I could move eastwards without acting in direct
opposition to the wishes of the English Government, and
the Chinese would certainly forgive me for not using their
passport.</p>

<p>The distant mountains in the north, which had but now
stood out in rosy colours like rows of houses in a great city,
now grew pale in the grey twilight, and the grand contours
were obliterated as another night spread its dark wings over
the earth. A flute sounded softly and sweetly among the
tents, and its tones lulled our weary wanderers to rest.</p>

<p>The following morning the camp looked unusually
small, for the hired horses and mules had remained behind
on the plain, where their guides had found water by digging.
They were thus spared a considerable detour. As a
precaution we took a couple of goatskin vessels full of
water, and filled all the bottles and cans. Just before
starting we saw our Ladakis lying full length by the overflow
of the spring thoroughly quenching their thirst, and
the horses were allowed as much water as they liked.</p>

<p>This day&rsquo;s route was excellent, firm and level; the
great trunk road in India could not be better, and hardly a
highway in Sweden. Masses of clouds appeared from the
east round to the south-west; a storm was probably raging in
the Karakorum, but its outskirts never reached us. Here
the ground was dry, and the exceedingly fine dust stirred
up by the caravan hung like steam over the earth. The
other columns, like ourselves, made for a goal previously
agreed upon, a mountain spur in the north-east. As we
approached it, we speculated whether we should see beyond
it Aksai-chin, the lake Crosby passed in 1903.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">61. <span class="sc">A Gully at Camp 8 (Aksai-chin).</span></td></tr></table>

<p>North of the spur a large flat plain extends, and here
the mirage was marvellously perplexing. The mountains
seemed to be reflected in a perfectly calm lake, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
surface did not look like water&mdash;it was bright, light and
airy; it was as transitory as a play of colours in the clouds,
and seemed as though it had a foundation of transparent
glass. The mule caravan, now in front of us, was also the
sport of the mirage: we saw it double as if it also were
passing beside a lake.</p>

<p>At last we reached the spur and rested there awhile.
Robert climbed up the side to look for the expected lake;
as he came down the detritus began to move, our horses
were frightened and wildly stampeded towards the east.
Fortunately, they followed the track of the caravan, which
was in the act of pitching the camp. The grazing at camp
No. 8 was the best we had seen since Pobrang, and water
was obtained by digging at a depth of 22 inches. Kulans
had supplied the fuel, for their dung was plentiful. The
place was so comfortable that we remained here the
following day, and made an excursion to an elevation of
sandstone and conglomerate almost in the form of an
upturned dish, which stands on the south of the plain and
turns its sharply clipped margin to the north. On the top
Muhamed Isa erected a cairn&mdash;he had a mania for cairns.
Little did I dream then that I should see these landmarks
again a year and a half later (Illustration 61).</p>

<p>At dawn next day we made another advance into the
forbidden land. The air was not quite clear, and we saw it
quivering over the ground; but above it was clearer, for the
crests of the mountains were more sharply defined than
their feet. We marched eastwards; on our right was
blood-red conglomerate, which lay upon green schists. On
the left the lake was now visible, its deep blue surface
contrasting vividly with the dull tones which prevailed
elsewhere. The sight of a lake was refreshing; it gave the
crowning touch to the scene. The country was open
eastwards to the horizon; only in the far distance one
snowy mountain appeared in this direction, but probably
our longitudinal valley extended along the north or south
side of this elevation. In short, the land was as favourable
as it was possible to be, and remained so for several days;
and I suspected that Lake Lighten, the Yeshil-kul, and the
Pul-tso, known from Wellby&rsquo;s, Deasy&rsquo;s, and Rawling&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
travels, lay in this valley, which in every respect was
characteristic of the Tibetan highlands.</p>

<p>The ground was like a worm-eaten board; the holes of
the field-mice lay so close together that all attempts to avoid
them were vain. Even on the intervals between them one
was not safe. Frequently the roof of a subterranean passage,
consisting of dry loose soil mixed with gravel, broke in.
Robert once made a somersault with his horse. These
troublesome rodents, which live on the roots of the <i>yapkak</i>
plants and grass, are very irritating.</p>

<p>The caravan had camped close to the shore, beside
splendid water, which a brook poured down in great
abundance into the salt lake. Late in the evening we saw
a fire burning in the far distance. Was it another traveller,
or had hunters wandered thus far? No, it was some of
our own people, who were watching the animals and had
kindled a fire to keep themselves warm. There were no
men in this desolate country but ourselves.</p>

<p class="center chap2">TO LAKE LIGHTEN</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">We</span> left camp No. 9 (16,171 feet) with a feeling of satisfaction,
for the country, as far as the eye could reach, was
quite level; its elevation above the lake shore was so
insignificant that it could not be detected without instruments.
The atmosphere was hazy; the pure blue of the
lake, a reflexion of the sky, had quite disappeared, and
now the water looked dull and grey. One of the hired
horses was left behind at the camp; its owner hoped to
save it, but he was disappointed, and he also betrayed
the horse, for he took another way home and mercilessly
abandoned the poor animal to solitude and the wolves.</p>

<p>We rode a long distance on the old lake bottom and
perfectly level stretches of clayey mud. Afterwards the
soil was of fine gravel, and as hard as though it had been
compressed by the weight of a steam-roller. Only in an
isolated drainage basin can such level expanses occur
among huge mountains. Weathering, precipitation, flowing
water, storm and wind work together in levelling the land.
All heights and ridges are thereby reduced, all hollows are
filled up with mud, sand, and rubbish. Far in the east the
country is quite open. Here giants riding on Indian
elephants would have room enough to play a game of polo
in grand style, and the swift-footed Jambas dromedaries
might run till they were tired, for even the restless west
wind finds no obstacle in its path. Antelopes and kulans
appeared in timid herds. Of human beings not a sign.
Yesterday some of the men saw three stones placed together
to form a hearth; perhaps they had to do with Crosby&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
expedition (1903), for he, too, passed eastwards from the
Aksai-chin lake to Lake Lighten.</p>

<p>In the north, on the left side of our route, we could
descry three stages or crests; nearest to us a row of small
dark-green hills; farther off a continuous chain without
snow on it, and quite in the background a main range with
a number of snowy peaks. On the south our longitudinal
valley was bordered by mountains gradually increasing in
height towards the east. At camp No. 10 we found all
we wanted, though the water was a little salt. Good luck
followed us, and we had reached, quite fortuitously, a much
more kindly country than we had ventured to expect.</p>

<p>Near the camp we crossed a stagnant creek and we
passed several others on September 12. It soon turned out
that a large river-bed, containing, however, little water, ran
to the lake, and all day long we fell in with indications of its
proximity. The landscape was monotonous, and showed
little variety during the day&rsquo;s march. But the ground was
all that could be desired, and if it so continued, it would
help us to make good progress into the heart of the
forbidden land. Grass now cropped up in larger quantities
than we had hitherto met with. It thrived best where the
soil was sandy. It grew in small tufts, green and succulent
only in the middle, for the rest was yellow and hard from
the frosts at night. The west wind, which swept all day
over Tibet, rustled pleasantly through the grass. Who
would have looked for a true prairie up here in North Tibet?
The ground was of a deep straw-yellow, but the vault of
heaven above us was clear and blue in spite of the wind;
it seemed to me as though an immense flag of the colours
of my native country enveloped heaven and earth. North
and south rose dark purple, greyish-yellow, red, and white-capped
mountains.</p>

<p>The land was so level that the caravan, though it was
an hour&rsquo;s march ahead, was visible as a short, narrow
black line against the horizon, not the slightest rise ever
hiding it from sight. In consequence of the mirage it
seemed to hover a little above the surface, and the animals
looked like fantastic long-legged camels.</p>

<p>At a spot where the grass was unusually good the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
hired detachment had made a halt; it had lost another
horse, and wished to try and save two other death candidates.
The packs were strewed about the ground, the
animals were grazing eagerly, and the men sat at the fire
with their backs to the wind and smoked in turns from a
common pipe.</p>

<p>Salt made the soil in some places white as chalk, in
others a thin layer of coarse quartz sand occurred with a
tendency to form dunes. The caravan had encamped, and
small scattered black points showed us that the animals
were grazing. A couple of spots, which were far removed
from the others, were riders in search of water. It was not
easy to pitch the tents; all the men must hold on with all
their strength, lest the canvas should be blown away or
torn into shreds, and at the same time coarse sand blew into
their faces. We were glad to get under cover at last, but
even then the wind roared and whistled through all the
holes and chinks, and the puppies were very uneasy. But
such a westerly storm has one advantage: it makes the
march easier, pushing on behind. One needs only to turn
and try riding against the storm to learn the difference.</p>

<p>The 13th began badly, for nine horses had made off
in the night, and Muhamed Isa with some Ladakis had
gone in search of them. Meanwhile we waited in a regular
snowstorm. Manuel was engaged in a very lively dispute
with Ganpat Sing; it was about a pair of stockings which
the latter had bought from our cook in Leh. But now
Manuel found that he could use them himself, and talked
over Ganpat Sing to retract the bargain. Manuel often
amused Robert and myself with his broken English. If it
snowed, he said &ldquo;The dew falls&rdquo;; if it stormed, &ldquo;There
seems to be a breeze in the air to-day&rdquo;; and when we left
the lake he asked when we should come to the next
&ldquo;pond.&rdquo; He thought the Aksai-chin lake a wretched
puddle compared with the boundless ocean at Madras.</p>

<p>After five of the lost horses had been caught I started
on the track of the mules. The land rose as slowly as
before, nothing was seen of the mountains through the
drifting snow; we might as well have been on the plains
of Mongolia or the Kirghiz steppe. The camp this day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
was pitched by a source at the foot of the mountains on
the northern side of the valley, where there was good
pasture. In the absence of a tent we were housed in
Sonam Tsering&rsquo;s round fortification of provision sacks,
where a fire burned in the middle and we were sheltered
from the wind. Towards evening Muhamed Isa sent word
that another horse had been recovered, but that it was
impossible to look for the others in the driving snow, and
he asked for furs and provisions from the main camp.
The man, however, whose unenviable duty it was to
return with these things to camp No. 11 through the
darkness and snow, could not find the caravan-bashi and
his companions, who had therefore to spend the night in
the open, exposed to the frost and without food and drink.
They were much exhausted when they rejoined us next
day with all the missing horses. I gave my night watchmen
a scolding, and insisted strongly that this must not
occur again, for the animals were tired by these wanderings
and exposed to the attacks of wolves, and the march was
delayed. It was, however, really wonderful that we had
so far lost only a mule and two horses (Illustration 64).</p>

<p>And now we went on eastwards, still in the same great
longitudinal valley. The river contained more water the
higher we mounted, for below the water was lost by
evaporation and percolation into the ground.</p>

<p>The red conglomerate continued on our right, on the
left were green schists. In the midst of the sterile valley
we passed a small round oasis of grass, like a coral island
in the ocean. The day&rsquo;s storm brought us rain and
muggy weather; about mid-day it poured down and the
thermometer marked 39°. All was uncomfortably wet and
dirty when we formed our camp, and the damp fuel
would not catch fire. Then it began to snow, and late
in the evening the country was again clothed in wintry
white. We had hoped in vain to reach the saddle whence
Lake Lighten might be seen. According to Wellby&rsquo;s map
it might be still a couple of days&rsquo; march off, but under
favourable circumstances it must be visible from a long
distance.</p>

<p>Icy east wind blew next day. It was cold and raw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
as it passed over the snowfields, and the vile weather was
not only uncomfortable physically, but it had a depressing
effect on the spirits, so that we sat listlessly in the saddle,
were sleepy and indifferent, and longed for the brazier in
the evening. The antelopes were bolder than usual; at
this season they are fat and strong. We rode past a horse
which had fallen and died on the track; nothing could
have been done for him. He lay with wide-opened eyes
as though looking for a land in the east, and he was still
quite warm. The pack-saddle had proved useful, for
Muhamed Isa had thoughtfully had all the saddles stuffed
with hay for future use. So the animals could little by
little consume their own pack-saddles. In camp two sheep
were slaughtered, for they showed signs that they would
not hold out much longer.</p>

<p>In the morning a dying horse lay among the tents. A
wolf crouched in a side valley, watching our departure and
looking forward to a grand meal; but he would not have
the pleasure of killing the horse, for we put an end to its life
with a knife. We had now entered on a critical period,
for scarcely a day passed without our losing one or more of
our animals.</p>

<p>We still mounted slowly eastwards, and, trusting to
Wellby&rsquo;s map, I had promised my people that they should
this day get sight of a lake. We ascended a rise in the
ground, but from the summit only another was visible,
which quite blocked up the view, and when we had surmounted
this there was a third in front of us. Now, however,
our expectations were no longer to be disappointed.
Part of the blue lake appeared in the east-south-east,
encased in hills. On its southern shore, where Wellby
had travelled in 1896, rose singular irregular points and
groups, the continuation of the red snowy range which we
had seen for several days past, and now, in fine weather,
stood out in all its wild beauty. We had mounted for six
days towards the expected pass, and found it just above the
lake. Its height was 17,300 feet.</p>

<p>Now the horses were so exhausted that we must find good
pasture at any cost, and let the animals rest a few days.
Camp No. 15 was pitched on the strand, and afforded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
a view over all the lake. To the south rose the singular
range in shades of yellowish-red and scarlet, pink, and
light brown, and fantastic precipitous rocks stood out between
soft snowfields of a glistening bluish tinge.</p>

<p>Camp No. 15 was to be a notable station in our bold
raid into the forbidden land (Illustration 57). We had
scarcely got things in order when the last eight of the hired
Tankse men, attended by Muhamed Isa, appeared before my
tent, fell on their knees after the Ladak custom, touched the
ground with their foreheads, and then sat motionless as
images while their leader and foreman spoke as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sahib, we have nineteen horses left; eight of them are
still strong, but the rest will not last much longer. Oh,
Sahib, let us return home before winter comes and our
animals perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was agreed that you should accompany us as far as
the Yeshil-kul; do you mean to break your word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sahib, we know that we are in your hands, and are
dependent on your favour; our provisions will not last
more than ten days; if we go as far as Yeshil-kul we shall
all die on the return journey. Oh, Sahib, have pity on us,
and let us go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. If I let you go, which road will you take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sahib, we will travel over the mountains here in the
south, and pass by Arport-tso to the Lanak-la, which one
can reach in ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you find your way, and are you sure that your
supplies will last out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then make ready to start.&rdquo; Turning to Muhamed
Isa I continued: &ldquo;Manuel and the two Rajputs cannot
bear this climate, and it is best to let them go also before
the cold winter comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muhamed Isa was a diplomatist, and tried to conceal
his satisfaction as he answered: &ldquo;Yes, if we take them
with us farther into the country in winter they will freeze
to death. Already they crawl together like marmots to the
fire, and yet their teeth chatter and they tremble from cold
in their furs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can easily do without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hitherto they have done no more work than the
puppies, or, rather, less, for they are either too lazy or too
grand to collect fuel for their own fire; two of our Ladakis
have to attend on them and their horses. It would be a
great gain if we were quit of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them go, and then we shall have the use of their
horses, for I can hire some of the Tankse horses to be at
their disposal on the journey to Ladak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, they have three saddle-horses, besides two
others for their baggage. We are now losing the Tankse
horses, some of which, indeed, have only carried fuel, but, by
their departure, the baggage to be carried by our own horses
will be increased by fifteen other packages. Therefore the
black men&rsquo;s horses are a very necessary reinforcement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day the plates and rock specimens, to be forwarded
to Srinagar, were packed up, and I wrote letters home and
to friends in India. I begged Colonel Dunlop Smith to
send after me, in October, to the neighbourhood of Dangra-yum-tso,
with the permission of the Viceroy, all letters that
had come for me up to that time. They must be sent
through Gyangtse and Shigatse, and the Tashi Lama, who
had recently been so well received in India, would certainly
be very pleased to see that the post-bag was transmitted
to me. I thought that, even if I were forbidden to travel
further in the interior of Tibet, my letters would not be
held back&mdash;at the worst I could make the forwarding of
the mail a condition of the acceptance of the demands of
the Tibetans. I accordingly requested that a post-runner
should receive orders to reach Dangra-yum-tso at the end
of November, there to await my arrival.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 17 three of our own
horses lay dead among the tents. The following night the
great spotted Yarkand horse, which had carried our boat,
died (Illustration 67). When the sun rose on the 19th two
more victims had followed the others, and lay, with neck and
legs outstretched, frozen hard after a night frost of a degree
below zero. I summoned Muhamed Isa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many more animals have we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have 83: 48 horses and 35 mules; 10 horses and
a mule have died.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be bad if this dying goes on at the same rate as
in the last three days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think it will, Sahib; the weakest have
succumbed, the strongest remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But six horses are gone, and that means six more
loads for the survivors, besides the fifteen of the Tankse
horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The six fallen horses have carried nothing during the
last few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at any rate the loads will now be heavier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since we have been camping here I have given the animals
double measures of maize and barley, partly to
strengthen them, partly to lighten the loads. On the first
days, when we start from here, we must make short
marches, and rather let the horses eat their fill than throw
away a single sack of barley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. We have 510 English miles before us to the
Dangra-yum-tso, and that makes 51 days&rsquo; marches at the
rate of 10 miles a day. If 15 days of rest be added, we
should arrive at the lake on November 25, that is, in two
months and six days. The mules seem hardier than the
horses; we must try to keep a stock of strong mules; later
on we shall contrive something when we have met the first
nomads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, if it comes to the worst the Ladakis can carry
what is absolutely necessary, and we can all go on foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Muhamed, remember that I shall certainly not
turn back unless I am compelled by superior force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I know that; all will be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four horse-loads of maize and barley were consumed
in this camp; and henceforth a horse-load would be used
daily, not including the men&rsquo;s rations. But probably we
should also lose a horse a day, often, perhaps, two or more.
Still, there always remained a chance of finding better pasturage,
where the horses might recover their strength, when we
turned off to the south-east. We had at present no ground
for complaint. The hired horses had done us very great
service. We were able to leave the western shore of Lake
Lighten with 83 laden animals. Two horses were required
for our boat and all its appurtenances, but I intended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
spare them a couple of days, and let the boat be taken
over the lake.</p>

<p>So far we had succeeded in keeping our stages well in
advance, and that was good. Wellby, Deasy, Rawling,
and Zugmayer, who were all in this region, and brought
back such excellent, meritorious results, had here and at
Yeshil-kul caravans in a far less efficient condition than
mine. Leh and Tankse were my starting-points. But
the last connections with them were severed at Lake
Lighten, and here commenced a bold march towards an
unknown destiny.</p>

<p class="center chap2">ON THE LAKE IN A STORM</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">On</span> September 19 we took leave of the Hindus and the
natives of Tankse. I was sorry for the former; it was not
their fault that they could not bear the climate, and they
had had no opportunity of showing what they were worth.
On the last evening Bikom Sing had sung his swan-song
in our party, the same monotonous, melancholy Sanskrit
hymn which had so frequently reminded himself and his
fellow-countrymen of a warm country with pleasant huts in
the shade of palms and mango trees, of laden ox-carts on
dusty roads, and of the warning growl of the royal tiger in
the jungle by the river bank, when the full moon shines
from heaven on mild spring nights. I thanked them for
their good, faithful, and honest services, paid them well,
provided for their return journey, and handed them good
testimonials. They received supplies of meal, sugar, tea,
and rice, and a sheep for butcher&rsquo;s meat. Manuel was
allowed to take with him one of the puppies which he was
fond of. Muhamed Isa had sewed together a tent of
empty corn sacks, to protect them from the frosts at night.</p>

<p>They intended to travel on the first day only to the
foot of the red mountain chain, and the day was already
far advanced when they shook hands and mounted their
horses. We remained standing awhile, watching the little
party grow smaller under the sun in the south-west, and
soon disappearing behind the nearest hills.</p>

<p>I have never heard anything more of them. Eighteen
months later Manuel&rsquo;s father wrote to inquire where his
son was, but I did not know. So much I ascertained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
that he had arrived safely at Leh, but I could not track
him any farther. However, I hope that he will turn up
all right at home after his wanderings. We missed them
sorely, but we consoled ourselves with the boat, which was
unpacked and put together on the bank.</p>

<p>A bright clear day after 30 degrees of frost. The
rivulet at our camp was frozen into a shiny riband,
meandering to the strand, and along the bank a belt of
ice two yards broad flapped up and down under the beat
of the ripples. The water of the lake may be drunk in case
of necessity; probably its affluents reduce the salinity
along our shore, where the river descending from the pass
and numerous springs pour into it. The sand on the
bottom of the lake is finely and sharply rippled by the
oscillating movement of the waves, and the water is
crystal clear.</p>

<p>Now our horses, which had lost another comrade in
camp No. 15, were laden with heavy packs. The caravan
had orders to skirt the northern shore of the lake, and to
encamp at some suitable spot near it. Robert was to draw
a rough sketch of the shore-line; Tsering, Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s
brother, accompanied me at his own request. And so
we left at the same time this dreary place, where we had
parted with our companions and had lost seven horses.
Amid the silence of the desert it lay rocked to sleep,
as it were, by the murmur of the waves against the shore&mdash;a
burial-ground forgotten by gods and men.</p>

<p>Tsering soon got used to the oars, and afterwards the
west wind came to our assistance. We made across to the
north-western corner of the lake, and had a much less
distance to cover than the caravan, which had to make
a wide detour. The sail was only a trial trip, but I was delighted
from the first moment with the English boat, which
was solid and comfortable, and easy to steer. The greatest
depth we measured was 159 feet. After rounding a
promontory we caught sight of the bluish-grey smoke of
our camp a little distance from the shore, drew the boat on
to the beach, and rejoined our people.</p>

<p>The camp was arranged as follows: Muhamed Isa,
Tsering, two other men, and the kitchen were accommodated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
in a large tent, quadrangular below and pyramidal
above. The principal Ladakis lived in the Tibetan tent,
while the rest found shelter within the ramparts of the provision
sacks. Robert had Manuel&rsquo;s tent to himself, and
he had piled up so many boxes of all kinds round his
bed that it looked like a Parsee tomb. Outside, on the
right wing, stood my tent, a little apart from the others.
The black Pobrang dog was missing; probably he was
enjoying a feast on the seven dead horses; and so it was
in fact: when Muhamed Isa sent a man back to camp 15
there was the dog fat and bloated, like a tightly stuffed bag,
and so lazy and stupid that he could hardly move. He
had thoroughly overeaten himself, and would not look at
his food for a whole day after.</p>

<p>September 21 was a memorable day in our chronicles.
The boat lay on the shore ready to sail, and I resolved to
spare the horses its weight once more. Eastwards the
lake seemed quite small, and it could not be far to its
eastern bank, near which the caravan could encamp wherever
there was passable grazing. If it became too dark
before they heard anything of me, they could light a beacon
fire on the shore. But, of course, we should turn up in
good time. We looked upon the trip as a mere trifle, and
did not think of providing ourselves with food, drinking-water,
fuel, and warm clothing for the night. I was
dressed as usual, wore my leathern vest, and took my
ulster with me, and a fur coat was spread over the back
bench only to make a soft seat.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">70. <span class="sc">Rehim Ali, one of my Ladakis on the First Crossing of Tibet.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Yes, we were too thoughtless on this occasion. In the
forenoon I inspected the animals, as usual, and then gave
Rehim Ali a lesson in rowing, for he was to come with me
this time, and he did so well that he was solemnly appointed
<i>Kemibashi</i>, or admiral of the fleet. Just at starting I
decided to row across the lake, to sound its depth and
ascertain its breadth. The distances, or, more correctly,
the course, I measured with a log by Lyth of Stockholm,
and the depths were to be sounded every quarter of an
hour. We should certainly reach the rendezvous before
dark. At eleven o&rsquo;clock the temperature of the water was
43° F., and it rose afterwards a few degrees higher. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
day was bright and quite calm; at one o&rsquo;clock we noted 53° F.
I took the dark opening of a bank terrace as the point to
steer for. We could do without drinking-water, for the
hydrometer marked 1000 in the lake; it therefore floated
as low as in fresh water (Illustration 70).</p>

<p>The lagoons on our shore were covered with ice fully
half an inch thick. Six wild yaks were seen at the foot of
the mountain to the north. The lake lay deceptively quiet
and smooth; only a slow gentle swell, the last reminder of
the effect of the expiring night wind, could be felt. Not a
wisp of cloud, not the slightest breeze&mdash;weather all the
more enjoyable after the storms of the past days. The
lake shone against the light turquoise-blue vault of heaven,
when we looked southwards, with as bright a green as the
tender foliage of birches in the spring.</p>

<p>For a few minutes we heard the bells of the mules as
they tramped off, but the black line of the caravan soon
vanished in the hilly lands along the shore. Rehim Ali
rowed like a practised boatman. At the second sounding-station
the depth was 115 feet, and at the third 161.
When my oarsman shipped his oars the next time the
sounding-line, 213 feet long, did not reach the bottom;
unfortunately we had no reserve lines, for I had never
found before such great depths in a Tibetan lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This lake has no bottom at all,&rdquo; groaned Rehim Ali.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it has a bottom, but we have no more line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does not the Sahib think it dangerous to go further
when the lake is bottomless?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no danger on that account; we can row to
the shore, which is not far, and then we have only a short
distance to the camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inshallah, but it may be farther than it looks. Bismillah,&rdquo;
he cried, and he set to work again.</p>

<p>About two o&rsquo;clock the lake was as smooth as a sheet
of glass, and showed curious confused reflexions of the
mountains. We became quite dizzy in the head; the lake
had now assumed the same colour as the sky, and we might
have been soaring in a space of bright blue ether within a
magical spherical planet. Behind us, to the north, the
panorama of a mighty crest unrolled itself, with flattish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
lofty domes covered with eternal snow. The sun was
scorching hot, Rehim Ali wiped his brow, the smoke of
my cigarette hung motionless in the air, there was not
a ripple except those produced by the boat and the oars&mdash;it
was a pity to spoil the surface. All was quiet and
peaceful as a day in late summer which had lingered
among the mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God protect us from the darkness,&rdquo; said Rehim Ali;
&ldquo;it is dangerous to be on the water after the sun has set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the sounding-line touched the bottom at 95 feet,
and next time at 34 feet. A quarter of an hour later we
jumped ashore.</p>

<p>I drew a panorama of the northern mountains, while
Rehim Ali munched a piece of bread which he had providently
brought with him.</p>

<p>It was a quarter to four when we put off again. In
two hours it would be dark, but then we should see the
camp-fire on the shore. The east end of the lake seemed
quite close, but we were easily deceived by the mirage.
We rowed for a while east-north-eastwards along the shore.
It would be extraordinary if the west wind did not get up
on this day. I asked Rehim Ali repeatedly, for he had the
western horizon in front of him, if the view was clear in
that direction, or if the westerly storm was making its
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there is no storm,&rdquo; he answered quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now it is coming,&rdquo; he said, after a short interval;
&ldquo;and it will be a bad one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turn round and see in the west, above the pass we
had crossed some days before, high, light-yellow vortices
of sand and dust, which soon tower up to 30° above
the horizon; they rise rapidly, condense into a dark cloud,
and hide the view of the western heights. Yes, that is a
westerly storm coming on.</p>

<p>But the danger to us is not great; we can land wherever
we like; we have matches to light a fire, and sufficient
<i>yapkak</i> can be found, so we shall not freeze even with 29
degrees of frost; and we can do without food for once.</p>

<p>But we will not land; perhaps the camp is close to.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
&ldquo;Row on, Rehim Ali&mdash;no, wait a moment, set up the mast
and loose the sail before the storm breaks, and then we
shall get help for a part of the way. If the storm becomes
too violent we will go ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is still deadly quiet. But now comes the first forerunner&mdash;a
ripple skims over the surface, the wind catches
the sail, puffs it out like a ball, smoothing out all its folds,
the boat darts forwards, and a whirling, boiling track is
formed in our wake. We keep to the southern shore;
there lie a series of lagoons and spits of sand and pebbles.
A pair of black geese sit on one of these spits; they gaze
in astonishment as we pass; they perhaps take us for a
huge water-bird which cannot fly, because it has only one
wing. The lake is getting rougher; we fly towards a spit
to the north-east; oh, heavens! the water is only 3 feet
deep under our keel. If we run aground the boat will be
dashed to pieces; its oiled sailcloth is as taut as a drum-skin.
I put the helm over as far as possible, and graze the
spit amidst the raging surf; the man&oelig;uvre succeeds, and
the next minute we are in deep open water where the
waves are more moderate.</p>

<p>Now a spit shows itself to the east-north-east projecting
far into the lake, but it is a long distance off, and we are out
on the agitated lake, where the white horses are getting
higher and higher and their roar becomes louder and
louder; the whole lake is in the wildest commotion; if we
can only reach that landspit safe and sound we can get
under its lee and land safely. Yes, we must land by hook
or crook, for the storm is upon us; it becomes more violent
every moment and the mast cracks; I dare not sail any
longer with the sheet made fast. We have a grand sailing
wind, the water roars and rages under the stem and boils
and bubbles behind us. We have to look out, for if the mast
breaks, which already bends like a whip, the boat will tip
over, will fill in a moment, and will be sunk by the weight
of the centre-board, which is not in use but is carried as
cargo. We have two life-buoys as a last resource.</p>

<p>Rehim Ali sits in the bow. He clings to the mast,
keeps a look-out forwards, and reports that the lake beyond
the landspit is as extensive as in the west. We have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
the victims of an illusion, and cannot reach the eastern
shore before complete darkness overtakes us. Would it
not be better to land and wait for the day? Yes, let us
land and get into the lee of the landspit. The sun sinks,
the storm grows in strength, we can hear it howling through
the chasms to the south; fine spindrift flies like a comet&rsquo;s
tail over the crests of the waves; it is a most critical and
trying moment. The dust clouds have disappeared, and
the western horizon is dimly perceptible. The sun sinks
to its rest, a ball of liquid gold, and a weird, mysterious
gleam spreads over the whole country. Everything is
coloured red except the dark-blue white-edged lake. The
night rises out of the east, dark purple shades lengthen out
behind the mountains, but the most easterly pinnacles and
the summit T, rising above all the others with its glittering
snowfields, stands out fiery red against the dark background,
like volcanic cones of glass lighted within by
glowing streams of lava; a couple of riven clouds rush
eastwards, their crimson colour vying in beauty with the
snowfields and glaciers below them. All shades of rose-colour
play on the sail, and a purple foam quivers on the
crests of the waves as though we were being driven over a
sea of blood.</p>

<p>The sun sinks; now the sail and spray turn white, and
soon only the last tint of the evening red lights up the highest
snowfields. The night spreads further westwards, and the
last glow, the final glimmer of day, dies out on the summits
in the south-east.</p>

<p>Rehim Ali crouches at the bottom of the boat while we
shoot towards the landspit, tossing, rolling, and pitching.
All outlines are still sharp and clear. I steer the boat out
of the surf round the landspit, but then pause a moment;
it would be easy to get into lee-water; but no, all is
well now&mdash;the moon shines brightly, and before it goes
down we may perhaps reach another point.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">72. <span class="sc">In Peril on Lake Lighten.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Through driving spume and hissing foam we fly past
the point, and in a second it is too late to get under its lee,
however much we might wish to do so, for the roar of the
surge dies away behind us, and open water again yawns
before us black as night, bounded in the distance by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
scarcely perceptible strip of land, another spit of the gravel
so abundant on the southern shore.</p>

<p>So we speed over the disturbed lake. We start with a
fright, for we hear the huge waves rolling over behind us.
The dull droning comes nearer, and I turn round&mdash;we must
inevitably be buried under the heavy, rolling crests. A
faint gleam of the dying day still lingers in the west. The
spray, driven by the storm, gives us a cool bath. Then
the waves reach us, but they lift up the boat gently, and
then roll on towards the eastern shore, which Rehim Ali
does not expect to reach.</p>

<p>Now the sail is white in the moonshine, and my shadow
passes up and down it with the movement of the boat.
Rehim Ali is almost dead of fright; he has rolled himself
up like a hedgehog on the bottom of the boat and buried
his face in my ulster, so as not to see the agitated water.
He says not a word, he is quite resigned and is awaiting
his last moments. The distance to the eastern shore
cannot be estimated, and it is certainly impossible to effect
a landing there without shipwreck. If there are cliffs and
reefs on the shore we shall be mangled and crushed amid
the breakers, and if the strand slopes down gently we shall
capsize, and be thrown ashore by the great rolling billows
like a piece of cork (Illustration 72).</p>

<p>In the midst of the dark, indistinct chaos the surf at the
point of the landspit flashes out; it is more furious than at
the other point, for the waves have become larger as we
have left a wider expanse of lake behind us. I try to get
into the lee, but the storm drives us out again, and we are
away from the land before we are aware. It now becomes
colder, but I do not feel it, the excitement is too great,
and our lives are at stake. I look in vain for the beacon
of my servants; have they not obeyed my orders, or are
they so far from the shore that the fire is invisible? I
succeed in removing the back bench and sit on the bottom,
where I am somewhat protected from the cutting wind.
Behind us, the broken streak of moonlight on the water
makes the waves look more weird than before; they have
become gigantic, and the nearest hides all behind it.</p>

<p>The hours pass one after another; the moon sets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
Now all is pitch darkness; only the stars flicker like
torches over our heads, otherwise the deepest blackness
surrounds us. My right hand is gone to sleep, cramped
with grasping the rudder; the boat seems to dart eastwards,
but the waves roll past us&mdash;they are still quicker than we.
Now and then I ask Rehim Ali whether his cat&rsquo;s eyes can
see the breakers on the eastern shore. He casts a hurried
glance over the gunwale, answers that they are still very
far off, and buries his face again in the ulster. The tension
becomes more acute; whatever happens we are certainly
approaching the moment when the boat will be cast helpless
on the strand. I hope that the lake is so broad that we
may continue our wild career till daybreak. But no, that
is incredible, for there are no lakes so large in Tibet. We
have the whole night before us, and in this flying course we
can cover immense distances.</p>

<p>There is something uncanny and awe-inspiring in such
a sail, when the crests are visible in the darkness only when
they lift the boat, to roll onward the next moment. We
hear nothing but their swish, the howling of the wind, and
the hissing of the foam under the stem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, Rehim Ali,&rdquo; I call out; &ldquo;when you feel that
the boat has grounded, jump out and pull it with all your
strength to the beach.&rdquo; But he makes no reply; he is
quite paralyzed with fear. I pack up my drawings and
sketch-books in a small bag.</p>

<p>But what is that? I hear a thundering roar that
drowns the growling of the storm, and in the pitch-black
darkness I see something like a bright streak close to us.
That must be the surf on the shore. &ldquo;Loose the sail!&rdquo; I
cry, so loudly that my throat nearly cracks, but Rehim Ali
is helpless and does not move an inch. I undo the rope
and let the sail flap and beat just as the boat grinds
against the bottom and suddenly sticks fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump into the water and draw the boat up,&rdquo; I shout,
but he does not obey; I poke him in the back, but he
takes no notice. Then I seize him by the collar and throw
him overboard just as the next roller dashes up the beach,
fills the boat, turns it over, and soaks me to the skin.
Now I may as well jump out myself, but Rehim Ali at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
realizes the situation and helps me to draw the boat beyond
the reach of the waves (Illustration 73). The fur coat and
ulster are as wet as myself, and only after a long search do we
recover all the things that have been scattered in our shipwreck.</p>

<p>We were half-dead with weariness and excitement; one
almost loses one&rsquo;s breath altogether with such exertions in
this rare atmosphere. We mounted a sandy hillock and
sat down, but the cutting icy wind drove us away. Could
the boat provide us with shelter? We must draw out the
bolts which held the two halves together, and at last we
succeeded with the help of the centre-board. Uniting our
forces we heaved up one half of the boat, propped it up
with a plank, and crept under its shelter. We were quite
numbed; no wonder, for the water froze in our clothes so
that they crackled when touched. The water on the
bottom of the boat turned to ice; my fur coat was as hard
as a board, and was absolutely useless. Hands and feet
were stiff and had lost all feeling; we must get up again or
we should be quite frozen. There was only one thing to
do. In the shelter of the boat I took off my Kashmir
boots and my stockings, and Rehim Ali shampooed my
feet, but I felt no life in them till he had opened his
<i>chapkan</i> and warmed them for a long time against his
naked body.</p>

<p>There was no sign of life anywhere about. Amid the
roaring of the surf we had to shout to make ourselves
heard. How were we to pass the night with 29 degrees
of frost, and wet clothes already stiffened into cuirasses of
ice? Could we keep alive till the sun rose? Rehim Ali
disappears into the darkness to search for fuel, but he
comes back empty-handed. To my joy I discover that
my cigarette-case and matches are still available; I had
stood in the water only up to my breast, even when the
last breaker had done its best to wet me through. So I
light a cigarette and give one to Rehim Ali to cheer him
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there nothing here, then, that we can burn? Yes,
wait, we have the wooden roller of the sounding-line and
the frame in which it is fixed. Fetch them at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We ruthlessly break up this masterpiece of Muhamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
Isa&rsquo;s skill in carpentry, and hack in pieces the frame with
our knives; we lay aside the wet shavings, and use the
dry, inner sticks as firewood. They make a very tiny heap.
Only a couple are sacrificed at once, and I get them to
burn with some blank leaves from my note-book. Our fire
is small and insignificant, but it warms us famously, and
our hands thaw again. We sit close over the fire, and
keep it up with the greatest economy, putting on one
splinter at a time. I take off my clothes to wring them
as dry as I can; Rehim Ali dries my ulster, on which I
depend for the night; the fur coat is left to its fate. How
long is it to the dawn? Ah, several hours yet. The
roller and the handle are still in reserve, but this small
stock of wood cannot last long, and I look forward with
trepidation to the moment when the cold will compel us
to sacrifice the mast and the benches. The time passes
so slowly; we say little to one another, we long for the sun.
As soon as our clothing is a little dry we can boil water in
the baler, so as to get something warm into our bodies.</p>

<p>However, we had good reason to rejoice that we had
got off so well. I shall never forget Lake Lighten, Wellby&rsquo;s
and Deasy&rsquo;s lake. It had kept us company for several
days, we had lost seven horses on its banks, and our
friends had left us with the last letters. We had seen this
lake strikingly beautiful in bright light hues, but also
pitchy black, like a tomb, in the arms of night; it had lain
smooth and shining in the burning sunshine, but it had
also shown us its teeth, white shining teeth of foam and
spindrift. Not long ago we were almost roasted in the
heat of the sun on its unknown depths of crystal-clear,
vernal-green water; now we were on its bank nearly
frozen in the bitter, wintry cold; then it lay so still that
we hardly ventured to speak lest we should disturb its
peaceful repose; now it raved in unbridled fury. Its shores
had yielded us grass, spring-water, and fuel, but to the
voyagers in the night it had seemed almost boundless: the
eastern bank had retired before us all day long; we had
seen the sun rise, sink and set in a sea of purple and
flames, and even the moon accomplish its short journey
before we reached our goal where the surf thundered and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
folded us in a wet and cold embrace. We had made a
notable voyage in the small boat, full of variety and excitement;
thrice our lives had hung by a hair as we almost
ran aground on the landspits, for had we capsized there
we could hardly have reached land before our hands were
paralyzed on the life-buoys in the icy-cold water. Wonderful
lake! Only yaks, wild asses, and antelopes find
freedom on thy shores; only glaciers, firn-fields, and the
everlasting stars are reflected on thy surface; and thy
silence is only interrupted by the music of thine own waves
and the victorious war-song that the western tempest plays
on thy strings of emerald-green water.</p>

<p>At any rate we were still alive and on land without any
broken limbs. We longed for the grey of dawn, and kept a
tight hand on the fire, feeding it only now and then with a
fresh chip to prevent its going out altogether. Sleep was
out of the question, for we should be frozen. Sometimes
we nodded a moment while we sat cowering over the
flickering flames, and Rehim Ali occasionally hummed an
air to make the time pass.</p>

<p>I am just thinking how I should enjoy a cup of hot
tea, when Rehim Ali gives a start, and cries out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fire in the distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I ask, somewhat incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder, northwards, on the shore,&rdquo; he replies, pointing
to a feebly luminous point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a star,&rdquo; I say, after searching through the
darkness with a field-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is on this side of the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, have we not seen the fire before? They
would not light a beacon fire in the middle of the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a fire, it is a lantern; I see it moving about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, it is a light which changes its position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it does not appear again; perhaps it was only
an optical illusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there it is again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now it is gone again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it remained so long invisible that we lost hope, and
cowered over the embers of the last chips of the roller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Does not the Sahib hear something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it sounds like the tramp of horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and like men&rsquo;s voices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment the shadowy outlines of five large
horses and three men appear against the sky. The riders
dismount and approach us with joyful, friendly greeting.
They are Muhamed Isa, Rabsang, and Adul. They sit
down by us and inform us that camp No. 18 lies an hour&rsquo;s
journey to the north, a little distance from the shore. As
soon as the camp was pitched they had sent out men to
look out for us, but had given up the search, as these men
had found no signs of us and had seen no fire. Late
at night, however, Robert, feeling uneasy because of the
storm, had climbed a hill, and had seen our small fire.
He at once sent the three men after us. They said that
they had kept up a large beacon fire all the evening, but
apparently the inequalities of the ground had concealed it;
certainly we could not see it from the lake.</p>

<p>I borrowed two sashes from the men to wind round my
feet. Then we mounted, and with the lantern in front the
little cavalcade moved off northwards to the camp, while
the billows continued their ceaseless race towards the shore.</p>

<p class="center chap2">DEATH IN THE JAWS OF WOLVES&mdash;OR SHIPWRECK</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">When</span> we marched on September 22 over the old terraces
of the lake and up to the threshold of the pass separating
its basin from that of Yeshil-kul, the view of Lake Lighten
opened up more the higher we rose, and at length the
whole of the great blue lake in all its beauty lay before us
at the foot of the snowy mountains. The pasturage was
excellent everywhere, and the Pantholops antelopes in
their surprise and perplexity often did not know in which
direction to make their escape, and prompted by curiosity
came thoughtlessly to meet us. The pass has a height of
17,392 feet. We had proceeded only a few paces on the
other side when a complete change of scenery presented
itself, as though a leaf of a large book had been turned
over. The forms which had hitherto riveted our attention
vanished forever, and new mountains lay before us, a new
basin, and a new turquoise-blue lake&mdash;the Yeshil-kul. To
the south and south-west of the lake extend great flats of
pure white salt; concentric rings and isolated pools indicate
that Yeshil-kul also is contracting (Illustration 75).</p>

<p>During the following days we encamped in a country
where the grazing was good but the water slightly salt.
On the wide, flat plains on the west side of the lake stand
long rows of cairns, heaps of earth or skulls, piled up at
a distance of two or three yards apart. They look like
boundary marks, but, in fact, have been erected by antelope
hunters of the Changpa tribe, Tibetan nomads, who are
the &ldquo;Northmen,&rdquo; or natives of the northern plateau,
Chang-tang, and who in this way drive the game into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
their nooses laid in a hole. It should be explained that
antelopes have a decided objection to leaping over such
lines, and will rather run along them till they come to the
end. But before they reach it one of them has had the
misfortune of putting his foot in a ditch with a noose in it.
Only a son of the wilderness, who passes his life in the open
like the wild animals, could devise such a mode of capture.
My Ladakis informed me that the Changpas no longer hunt
here, for fear of the people of Eastern Turkestan, who
have often shown themselves hostile.</p>

<p>The 24th of September was another memorable day&mdash;my
sails on Tibetan lakes, curiously enough, almost always
ended in adventures. Of my Ladakis five had been in the
service of Deasy and Rawling, and two of them affirmed
that a shiny spot east-south-east was the spring where
Captain Deasy had encamped for ten days in July 1896,
and which he names in his narrative &ldquo;Fever Camp.&rdquo;
Their indication agreed with Deasy&rsquo;s map; so Muhamed
Isa was ordered to lead the caravan thither, light a large
beacon fire on the nearest point of the shore as soon as
darkness set in, and keep two horses in readiness.</p>

<p>Our plan was to sail in an east-north-easterly direction
for the northern shore, and thence southwards again to the
signal fire. Rehim Ali was on this occasion assisted by
Robert, who subsequently developed into an excellent
boatman. The lake was nearly quite calm; its water,
owing to its small depth, is greener, but quite as clear as
that of its western neighbour. It is so salt that everything
that touches it, hands, boat, oars, etc., glitters with
crystals of salt. The shore and bottom of the lake consist
chiefly of clay cemented together by crystallized salt into
slabs and blocks as hard as stone, so that great care must
be exercised when the boat is pushed into the water, for
these slabs have edges and corners as sharp as knives.
The lake is a salt basin of approximately elliptical outline
with very low banks; nowhere do mountains descend to
the strand. The three-foot line runs about 100 yards from
the shore; but even 650 yards out the depth is only 15
feet. We executed our first line of soundings across the
lake in the most delightful calm, and I steered the boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
towards the point I had fixed by observations. At one
o&rsquo;clock the temperature was 49° F. in the water, and 50½° in
the air. The depth increased very regularly, the maximum
of 52.8 feet occurring not far from the northern shore.
Robert was much delighted with the sail, and begged that
I would always take him with me in future, which I
the more readily granted that he was always cheerful
and lively, and that he gave me valuable help in all
observations. A little bay on the north shore served
us as a landing-place. We surveyed the neighbourhood,
and then hurriedly ate our breakfast, consisting of bread,
marmalade, <i>pâté de foie</i>, and water. My companions had
brought sugar, a tea-pot and enamelled bowls, but left
the tea behind; but this forgetfulness only raised our
spirits.</p>

<p>Then we put off again to make for the spring to the
south-east. A row of stone blocks and lumps of salt ran
out from the landing-place east-south-eastwards, and the
water here was so shallow that we had to propel our boat
with great care. Just as we had passed the last rock, of
which I took a specimen, the west wind got up, the surface
of the lake became agitated, and a couple of minutes later
white horses appeared on the salt waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up with the sail and down with the lee-boards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lake before us is tinted with shades of reddish
purple, a reflexion from the clayey bottom; there it must
be very shallow, but we shall soon pass it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see the small white swirls in the south-west?
Those are the forerunners of the storm, which stirs up the
salt particles,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the storm is bad, the boat will be broken on the
sharp ledges of the bottom before we can reach land,&rdquo;
remarked Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not clouds of salt,&rdquo; said Rehim Ali; &ldquo;that is
the smoke of fires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Muhamed Isa should be camping at Sahib
Deasy&rsquo;s source; that lies towards the south-west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no smoke there,&rdquo; replied Robert, who had
the field-glass; &ldquo;perhaps they have not been able to cross
the salt flats on the south of the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is their beacon fires which we see; but we
cannot cross over in this boat in a storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; suggested Robert, who always addressed me
thus, &ldquo;would it not be more prudent to land again before
the storm reaches its height? We should be safe behind
the stones, and we can gather a quantity of fuel before
sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will perhaps be best; this lake is much
more dangerous in a storm than Lake Lighten. We
have, indeed, no furs, but we shall manage. Take in the
sail and row behind the boulders. What are you gazing
at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, I see two large wolves, and we have no
guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right; two light, almost white, Isegrims were
pacing the shore. They were so placed that they must
be able to scent us in the boat; the odour of fresh live
meat tickled their noses. When we stopped they stopped
too, and when we began to move they went on close to the
margin of the water. &ldquo;Sooner or later you must come on
shore, and then it will be our turn,&rdquo; perhaps they thought.
Rehim Ali opined that they were scouts of a whole troop,
and said it was dangerous to expose ourselves to an attack
in the night. He had only a clasp-knife with him, and
Robert and I only pen-knives in our pockets; we had,
therefore, little chance of defending ourselves successfully.
Robert, for his part, preferred the lake in a storm to the
wolves. I had so often slept out of doors unarmed, that
I no longer troubled myself about them. But in the midst
of our consultation we were suddenly compelled to think of
something else. The storm came whistling over the lake.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:999px; height:596px" src="images/img77.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">77. <span class="sc">Death in the Jaws of Wolves&mdash;or Shipwreck.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Fortunately, the sail was still standing and the centre-boards
were down; the wind caught the canvas, the water
began to rush under the stern, and we shot smoothly southwards
with a side wind. Robert gave vent to a sigh of
relief. &ldquo;Anything but wolves,&rdquo; he said. I made Robert
and Rehim Ali row to save time, and soon the two beasts
were out of sight. &ldquo;They will certainly gallop round the
lake, they know quite well that we must land somewhere,&rdquo;
said Robert. He was quite right, the situation was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
exceedingly unpleasant; we had only a choice between
the storm and the wolves. We could not depend on our
people; they were evidently cut off from us by salt
morasses, which it was dangerous to venture into. We
would therefore try to reach a suitable point on the south
shore before dark (Illustration 77).</p>

<p>The hours fled past, and the sun sank in glowing yellow
behind the mountains. For two hours we held on our
course towards Deasy&rsquo;s camp, but when the beacon fires
became more distinct in the gathering twilight we changed
our direction and steered southwards to reach our people.
The distance, however, was hopelessly long, and just from
that direction the storm blew, and in the broken, freakish
light of the moon the waves looked as weird as playing
dolphins. Sometimes I was able to take some rapid
soundings; they gave depths of 32 and 36 feet. Our
fate was just as uncertain as on the former occasion on
Lake Lighten; we steered for the shore, but did not know
how far off it was. Rehim Ali judged from the length of
the path of moonlight on the water that it was a long
distance. Two more hours passed. I gave my orders to
the oarsmen in English and Turki. We had now the
waves on our quarter, and if we did not parry their rolling,
foaming crests they would fill the boat and sink it; so we
had to sail straight against them.</p>

<p>The situation was not a little exciting, but good luck
attended us. The boat cut the waves cleanly, and we got
only small splashes now and then. The spray trickled
down our necks, was pleasantly cool, and had a saline
taste. I again took soundings, and Robert read the line:
33 feet, then 25, and lastly 20.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the southern shore cannot be very far,&rdquo; I said;
but my companions remained still and listened. &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A heavy storm from the west,&rdquo; answered Rehim Ali,
letting his oar fall.</p>

<p>A regular humming noise was heard in the distance,
which came nearer and nearer. It was the storm, which
swept over the lake with redoubled violence and lashed up
foam from the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall not reach the shore before it overtakes us.
It will be here in a minute. Master, we shall capsize if
the waves become twice as high as they are now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waves swelled with incredible rapidity, the curves
in the streak of moonlight became greater and greater, we
rocked as in a huge hammock. The sounding-line had
just marked 20 feet. How long would it be before the
boat would ground on the hard, salt bottom, if it found
itself in a trough between two waves? The lee-boards
beat against the sides, the boat pitches and rolls, and any
one who does not sit firmly and stiffen himself with his feet
must go overboard. A terrible wave, like an all-devouring
monster, comes down upon us, but the boat glides smoothly
over it, and the next moment we are down in a trough so
deep that all the horizon is concealed by the succeeding
crest. We were not quick enough in negotiating this new
wave; it ran along the gunwale and gave us a good foot-bath
(Illustration 78).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, it looks dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is not exactly pleasant, but keep quiet. We
cannot land in such a sea. We must turn and make for
the open lake. About midnight the storm may abate, and
then we can land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can only keep on rowing so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will help ourselves with the sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not tired yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To land on the southern shore would be certain shipwreck;
we should all be drenched to the skin, and that is
dangerous on this night when we cannot reckon on the
slightest help from the caravan. We shall be frozen
before the dawn. To look for fuel before the sun sets is
not to be thought of, for the saline plains in the south are
absolutely barren. No, we will turn.</p>

<p>At the same moment we felt a violent blow, which made
the boat tremble. The larboard oar, which Rehim Ali
worked, had struck against the ground and started loose
from the screw which fastened it to the gunwale. Rehim
Ali managed to catch hold of it just in time, while he
shouted, &ldquo;It is only a stone&rsquo;s throw to the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how is this?&mdash;here the lake is quite smooth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A promontory juts out into the lake. Master, here
we shall find shelter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then we are saved; row slowly till the boat
takes ground.&rdquo; That soon happened, the sail was furled,
the mast unshipped. We took off our boots and stockings,
stepped into the water, and drew the boat on to dry land.
My feet were so numbed in the briny water, cooled down to
41°, that I could not stand, and had to sit down and wrap
my feet in my ulster. We found a patch of lumps of salt,
thoroughly moist, indeed, though drier than elsewhere, and
the best spot to be had; for water lay all around us, and
the bank was extremely low. How far it was to really dry
ground we could not ascertain; the moon threw a faintly
shining strip of light for a considerable distance farther
towards the land.</p>

<p>While I endeavoured to restore life to my feet by
friction, the others carried our belongings to our wretched
salt island. Then the boat was taken to pieces, and the
two halves were set up as shelters. At nine o&rsquo;clock we noted
31° on the thermometer, and at midnight 17½°; yet it was
warmer now than on the previous days, for the water of
the lake retains some of the heat of the summer air.
Muhamed Isa had made a new roller for the sounding-line,
with frame and handle, out of an empty box; it was of
course immediately utilized as fuel.</p>

<p>The provision bags and the water-cans were brought
out again, and we drank one cup of hot sugar-and-water
after another, and tried to imagine it was tea. As long as
the fire lasted we should not freeze&mdash;but then, what a
night! Towards ten o&rsquo;clock the wind abated&mdash;now came
the night frost. We lay down on the life-buoys to
avoid direct contact with the briny soil; Robert had
the fur coat, I the ulster, and Rehim Ali wrapped himself
in the sail. He slept huddled up together, with his forehead
on the ground, as is the Mohammedan custom, and he
did really sleep. Robert and I rolled ourselves together in
a bunch, but of what use was it? One cannot sleep just
before freezing. My feet were, indeed, past feeling, but
this consolation was a sorry one. I stood up and stamped
on the salt patch, and tried to walk without moving, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
space was very limited. I sang and whistled, I hummed a
song, and imitated the howl of the wolves to see if they
would reply. But the silence was unbroken. I told
anecdotes to Robert, but he was not amused by them. I
related adventures I had had before with wolves and
storms, but they had little encouraging effect in our present
position. We looked in vain for a fire; there was nothing
to be seen in any direction. The moon slowly approached
the horizon. The wind had sunk entirely. Little by
little the salt waves, splashing melodiously against the
shore, also sank to rest&mdash;an awful silence reigned around.
We were too cold to think much of the wolves. Twice we
raised a wild scream, but the sound of our voices died away
suddenly without awaking the slightest echo; how could it
reach the camping-ground?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it is midnight, Robert; in four hours it will be
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, I have never been so starved in my life. If
I get back to India alive, I shall never forget this dreadful
night on Yeshil-kul and the hungry wolves on the shore,
though I live to a hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense. You will think of it with longing, and
be glad that you were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all very fine to look back on, but at present I
should be delighted to have my warm bed in the tent and
a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life in Tibet is too monotonous without adventures;
one day&rsquo;s journey is like another, and we want a little
change occasionally to wake us up. But we will take tea
and firewood with us next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you have more of such lake voyages, Master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if there is an opportunity; but I fear that
the winter cold will soon make them impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it, then, be still colder than now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is nothing to what the cold will be in two
months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is it, Master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock; we shall soon have been lying six
hours on the morass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We nodded a little once more, but did not really sleep for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
a minute; from time to time Robert told me how badly his
feet were frozen. At three o&rsquo;clock he exclaimed, after a long
silence: &ldquo;Now I have no more feeling in any of my toes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun will soon come.&rdquo; At a quarter past four begins
a faint glimmer of dawn. We are so chilled through that
we can hardly stand up. But at length we pull ourselves
up and stamp on the ground. Then we cower again over
the cold ashes of our fire. We constantly look to the east
and watch the new day, which slowly peeps over the
mountains as though it would look about before it ventures
out. At five o&rsquo;clock the highest peaks receive a purple
tinge, and we cast a faint shadow on the bottom of the
boat, and then the sun rises, cold and bright-yellow, over
the crest to the east. Now the springs of life revive.
Rehim Ali has disappeared for an hour, and now we see
him tramping through the swamp with a large bundle of
wood, and soon we have kindled a sparkling, crackling fire.
We undress to get rid of our wet and cold clothes, and
warm our bodies at the flames, and soon our limbs are
supple again.</p>

<p>Then Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tall figure appears on horseback
in the distance. He ties a cord to the foreleg of his horse
and leaves it at the edge of the swamp, while he proceeds
on foot. When I was suffering most severely from cold I
had composed a sharp curtain-lecture for him as soon as
we met. But now when I caught sight of my excellent
caravan leader I forgot it all, for I had to admit the
validity of his reasons for delay. The caravan was long
detained in dangerous, unstable ground, and the men had
to carry everything. We went together to Deasy&rsquo;s camp,
which the caravan reached also. When the sun attained
its highest altitude at mid-day, it found me still in the arms of
Morpheus. I take it for granted that my two companions
also requited themselves for the loss of their night&rsquo;s rest.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 26 two horses were
nearing their end; they could not get on their feet and had
to be killed; one had died in the previous camp, and one
fell on the march. We had lost 15 horses out of 58, and
only 1 mule out of 36; these figures are distinctly in
favour of the mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span></p>

<p>We now rode along the great longitudinal valley, where
favourable ground made our progress easy, and passed a
salt basin, with a pool in the middle surrounded by concentric
rings of desiccation as regular as the benches of an
amphitheatre. Before us in the distance was seen the
caravan in two detachments, appearing like two small
black spots in the boundless open landscape. I was
deeply impressed by my own insignificance compared to
the distances on the earth&rsquo;s surface, and when I remembered
that we travelled at most 13 miles a day, I was
overwhelmed at the thought of the length of way we must
traverse before we had crossed Tibet. Wolves were seen
at the foot of a hill; perhaps they were our acquaintances
of yesterday. We had to leave them, much against our
will, an abundant banquet at the last camp, where six
ravens had swooped down on our fallen horses.</p>

<p>One of the uppermost &ldquo;benches,&rdquo; which stood some
160 feet above the surface of the pool, afforded a capital
road. Round about the soil was chalky white with salt.
To the right of us was a low, brownish-purple ridge.
Soon, with my usual companions, Robert and Rehim Ali,
I came up with a worn-out horse. He did not look at all
emaciated, but he had been relieved from duty for several
days in hopes of saving his life. His guide came into
camp in the evening, and reported that he had collapsed
on the road and expired. The country is somewhat hilly,
but solid rock seldom crops out, and then it is limestone
and light-green clay-slate.</p>

<p>The camping-ground on this day, No. 22, had an interest
of its own. Captain H. H. P. Deasy, on his remarkable expedition
through West Tibet and Eastern Turkestan during
the years 1896-1899, had great difficulties to contend with,
and lost so many animals that, in order to save the
expedition and its results, he had to leave behind a large
part of his baggage and provisions, in short, everything
that could be spared at all. In the year 1903 Captain
Cecil Rawling made an equally meritorious journey of
exploration through the same parts of Tibet, and as he
found himself in a very critical situation through want of
provisions, he decided to search for Deasy&rsquo;s depôt, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
according to the map, must be somewhere in the neighbourhood.
Two of Rawling&rsquo;s men, Ram Sing and Sonam
Tsering, had also accompanied Deasy, and Sonam Tsering
was able to point out the place where the baggage and
provisions had been buried. Thanks to the stores of rice,
meal, and barley, found there in the wilderness, Rawling
was able to save his horses, which would otherwise have
been lost, and a small bag of horse-shoes and nails came
in very usefully for their hoofs.</p>

<p>Sonam Tsering now accompanied me on my expedition.
I had ordered him in the morning to halt at Deasy&rsquo;s and
Rawling&rsquo;s camp, and therefore he marched on this day in
the front with the mules. It was, of course, of great importance
for my route survey to visit a spot so accurately
fixed.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest difficulty in finding the spot,
and when we reached the camp, which lay on a small flat
space between gently rounded hills, Muhamed Isa had
already digged out seven boxes. One of them contained
flour, which had gone quite bad in the long interval, and
probably was already spoiled when Rawling was here three
years before. Only one box was of Tibetan workmanship,
for Rawling, as Sonam Tsering informed me, had exchanged
some of his worn-out Kashmir boxes for Deasy&rsquo;s Turkestan
chests, which were much better. But even Rawling&rsquo;s
boxes were better than the easily damaged wooden boxes
from Leh, in which we kept candles and tinned meats. We
therefore appropriated some of them and used our own as
firewood. After all, Rawling had so thoroughly ransacked
the depôt that there was very little left for me; but I was
not in such urgent need of the goods. Some boxes of
American beef were very welcome to the dogs, but the
men despised them as long as we had fresh mutton.
Cubical tins, which had contained Indian meal, lay all
about the place. One of the boxes held a quantity of
empty cartridge-cases; they had not been used, and Sonam
Tsering believed that the Changpas had been here a couple
of years after Rawling, and had picked out the powder;
he pointed out to me one or two fireplaces, which seemed
much more recent. In another box we found a shipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
almanac and some map-sheets of Upper Burma&mdash;Deasy
had planned to pass into that country, but had been prevented
by sickness and death in his caravan. A packet of
blotting-paper came in very handy, for Robert had started
a herbarium for me; and Muhamed Isa discovered some
ropes in good condition. Besides these things, we took
only a couple of novels and Bowers&rsquo; description of his
journey in Tibet in 1891, a welcome addition to my very
scanty library (Illustration 79).</p>

<p>We were now in a country which several travellers had
visited before me. Wellby and Malcolm, who discovered
Lake Lighten, a lake already touched by Crosby, I have
already mentioned. Dutreuil de Rhins, Wellby and Malcolm,
Deasy, Rawling, and the Austrian naturalist, Zugmayer
(1906), had been at Yeshil-kul. I crossed the route
of the last a couple of months after his journey; he, like
the Frenchman and the English explorer, has written a
valuable book on his observations. At the time I knew
nothing of his journey, but now I find that I crossed his
route only at one point. Wellby&rsquo;s and Dutreuil de Rhins&rsquo;
paths I crossed only once, but Deasy&rsquo;s at two points. In
the following days it was harder to avoid the districts
where Wellby and Rawling had been, and where the latter
especially, with the help of native surveyors, had compiled
such an accurate and reliable map that I had no prospect of
improving it.</p>

<p>Consequently, I longed for country which had never
been touched by other travellers. My camp 22 was
identical with Rawling&rsquo;s No. 27, and his expedition had
skirted the lake Pul-tso, which lay a day&rsquo;s march in front
of us, both on the northern and southern side. Therefore,
to avoid his route, I made for the middle of this lake,
which stretches north and south, an unusual orientation.</p>

<p>When the great caravan is loaded up, and starts at
sunrise, the camp is usually full of noise and commotion.
In consequence of our daily loss of baggage horses the
loads have always to be re-arranged; when, however, the
crowd has moved off, all is quiet again, the iron brazier and
the hot bath-water are brought, and in my tent, with its
opening turned to the east, because the prevailing wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
blows from the west, it is soon as hot as in a vapour bath.
This heat often tempts one to put on lighter clothing, but
one soon regrets it, for it is always cold outside. Then we
go on through the desolate country where three expeditions
have converged to the same point.</p>

<p>The soil is brick-red, the pasturage good everywhere.
To the south lie low hills with arched tops, to the
north stretches the immense mountain system of the
Kuen-lun with several imposing mountain masses covered
with eternal snow, and just in front of us rises the colossal
dome-shaped, snow-covered massive, which Rawling named
the &ldquo;Deasy Group.&rdquo; We had seen this gigantic elevation
from Yeshil-kul, and it would serve us for a landmark for
several days to come.</p>

<p>The caravan encamped on the bank of the Pul-tso (16,654
feet) near a small rock of limestone. Tundup Sonam, the
&ldquo;Grand Court Huntsman&rdquo; of the caravan, begged to be
allowed to go out shooting, and was given four cartridges.
After a few hours he returned with three cartridges, and
showed a yak&rsquo;s tail as a proof that he had killed a huge beast,
which he had found grazing peacefully by itself behind the
hills to the south. Now the caravan had fresh meat to last
ten days; &ldquo;and when it is consumed, Tundup will shoot us
another yak,&rdquo; said Muhamed Isa, who was always much
pleased when men he had picked out made a good job of
their work. I had marrow from the yak&rsquo;s bones for dinner&mdash;a
dish that would not have disgraced the table of Lucullus
(Illustrations 68, 69).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span></p>

<p class="center chap2">GREAT LOSSES</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">We</span> had scarcely pitched our camp on the west shore of
the Pul-tso when Muhamed Isa came to ask for a day&rsquo;s
rest. The grazing, he said, was good, fuel abundant, and
the animals needed a little time to recover. I fell in with
his wishes the more readily that they fitted in with my
own plans&mdash;another lake voyage. I intended to go with
Robert and Rehim Ali early in the morning across the lake
in the direction of a precipitous mountain which lay 56°
east of north; then we would sail over to the south bank
and pass the night at a mountain 62° east of south. The
following morning we expected to reach the north-east
corner of the lake, where the caravan would wait for us on
the yellowish-green pastureland. We should thus take
two days on the lake to cover a distance which the caravan
would traverse in one day. We would take with us food,
warm clothing and bedding, and a quantity of fuel, that we
might not be in such straits as last time. Water was not
wanted; the lake water was potable, though it had a rather
queer taste.</p>

<p>The lake looked very inviting and picturesque at even,
its perfectly smooth mirror lying dark, dreamy, and silent
between the mountains capped with eternal snow. Great,
reeking fires of dung burned cheerfully among the tents,
the men prepared their supper, or mended the pack-saddles,
chatting merrily the while; all was quiet and
peaceful, and the moon floated, silvery white and cold,
among rose-coloured clouds.</p>

<p>Then I hear far in the east a droning sound, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
swells up rapidly, comes nearer, and changes into deafening
thunder, and in a moment a very violent storm sweeps
over the shore. I call men to close the opening of my
tent. I hear Robert raise a whoop as his airy dwelling flaps
about and threatens to split up into shreds. But a dozen
men set it to rights again. Then my tent is strengthened
with sand heaps and boxes; I am shut in with my brazier,
but a small spy-hole is left in the tent opening. The
moonshine glistens on the surf of the billows rolling
against the shore&mdash;a grand spectacle&mdash;wild, weird, almost
theatrical in its beauty. A storm of unsurpassed violence
rushes ruthlessly along. It sounds like express trains
rolling through covered stations; it lashes, roars, and
howls, and dashes the surf thundering against the beach.
The fires, but now flickering so cheerfully, are put out;
the spray is spurted out like rockets; I hear Muhamed
Isa&rsquo;s tent flapping about; then the sound of men&rsquo;s voices
is heard no more, only the howling of the storm and the
thunder of the waves disturb the silence of the wilderness.
If I do but look out of my spy-hole I am almost suffocated
by the pressure of the condensed air. Only the yaks
delight in such weather; they grunt and snort with pleasure
when the long black fringes of hair on their flanks flutter
in the gusts.</p>

<p>September 28, however, was clear, the storm had sped
off on its course to the west, and the dull splashing of the
swell on the beach was all that was left of its fury. Before
we were half way along the first line of soundings, the lake
was again as smooth as a mirror; it was only flecked with
small flakes of foam left behind by the storm. The water had
been too thoroughly stirred up to be clear. We took little
more than an hour to reach the rocky promontory, sounding
on our way a maximum depth of nearly 56 feet. We
left on the north a considerable bay which the caravan
would have to go round.</p>

<p>After a short rest we continued our voyage to the
south-east, and were well helped on our way by a gentle
northerly breeze. This time we reached the shore without
any adventures and before sunset. We landed with all
our belongings. Rehim Ali collected heaps of dry dung,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
Robert set the camp in order, and I cruised about in the
evening breeze till twilight came, and cold and darkness
surrounded our bivouac. We sat down by the fire, talked,
and cooked. The mince of fried sheep&rsquo;s brains and
kidneys tasted delicious in the open-air. To the west we
could see the fires at camp No. 23. Later in the evening
a strong east wind rose up again, and the waves dashed
against the shore barely two yards from us. We rolled
ourselves in our furs and gazed into the fire; the head is
never so full of projects and aspirations as when the eyes
follow the play of the blue flickering flames and the fiery
forms that arise in the glow.</p>

<p>But the storm increased in violence, we could hardly
keep the fire alive, and soon we crept under the boat, which
we used as a shelter without taking it to pieces. We all
three lay in this improvised tent, and strengthened it with
the sail and two tarpaulin cases, which covered the halves
of the boat on the march, and which we had brought with
us to protect our night wraps and beds in bad weather.
Above us hung a lantern which we extinguished when we
were ready; now the moon shone on the sail, the tempest
howled and moaned round the boat, and the surf soon lulled
us to sleep.</p>

<p>The minimum thermometer marked 14°; it is always
warmer near lakes. We were early on our feet, a good fire
put new life into us, and we breakfasted beside it, the
sun looking on. Our berth for the night was restored
to its element, the baggage was packed in, we stepped on
board and steered eastwards to the entrance of a passage
which divides the Pul-tso into two basins. Its breadth is
about 65 yards; in the southern basin the water was often
almost red with small crustaceæ. We crossed it south-westwards,
and found depths of barely 46 feet. Then a
strong breeze came up from the north-west, and the waves
splashed and lapped against the boat. If we only got a
south-west wind we could easily sail to the appointed
rendezvous. We would wait a little by the shore. It
curves gracefully, and has four terraces, each about two
yards high.</p>

<p>On the sail back a new line was sounded, the maximum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
depth being about 60 feet. Now we had a favourable wind
on the quarter, let down the weather-board, hoisted the
sail, and danced along to the strait. As we came up to its
eastern point, a rider with spare horses and several men on
foot came in sight. It was Muhamed Isa coming to meet
us. Now Rabsang relieved Rehim Ali, but he was so
awkward with the oars, that we preferred to take back our
old oarsman. We said good-bye to the rescue party, and
steered northwards over the northern basin of the lake,
where the depths were 10 feet at most. Unfortunately the
wind veered to the north, so that we were thoroughly
chilled through during the two hours&rsquo; sail to the north
shore.</p>

<p>Muhamed Isa had brought us sad news: two more
horses and a mule had died at camp No. 23; in the
evening another horse died. Otherwise the caravan at
camp No. 25 was sound and lively. Therefore we were
the more astonished to see a large fire at the abandoned
camping-ground in the west. The caravan had started
towards eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and now it was four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Not a soul had remained behind in
camp No. 23, and yet there was the fire; we saw flames and
smoke, which hung like a great veil over the shore. Rehim
Ali thought that the post from Ladak had caught us up at
last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that is impossible; a post-runner cannot travel so
far and carry his rations with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the camp-fire must have gone out immediately
after the departure of the caravan. A fire does not burn
so brightly with no one to attend to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smoke of camp No. 25 can be plainly seen from
camp No. 23. If the post had reached camp No. 23 it
would not have stayed there a minute, but would have
hurried on to join us before night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sahib, but perhaps the messenger is so exhausted
that he is signalling for help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it not be Changpas?&rdquo; remarked Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, it may be Tibetans, sent from the south
to order us to stop, or at least to watch us, and report to the
nearest headman.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, perhaps we shall have to stop sooner than we
think. What is to happen then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think that the Tibetans can interfere with us
so far to the north; they cannot force us to turn back. At
the worst we shall have to pass eastwards through Central
Tibet to China or Burma, as Bower did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, now, how it smokes; this great fire must mean
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a regular will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, a Saint Elmo fire.
The gods of the lake have lighted it to lead us astray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it is the post, but the fire looks uncanny,&rdquo;
said Rehim Ali, and rowed with all his might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not disturb yourself. If it is the post we shall
hear of the messenger before evening; I believe that the
camp-fire has not gone out, but has smouldered on in a
sheltered spot all day long; when the wind changed, some
reserve heap of dung caught fire, and, fanned by the
north wind, it has burst into flames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At six o&rsquo;clock we were home again. After I had taken
a much-needed meal I summoned Muhamed Isa and
Sonam Tsering to a consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many horses have we left?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Forty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many mules?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thirty-four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they in fairly good condition?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, Sahib,
not all; four of my horses and six of Sonam&rsquo;s are at
the point of death, and five mules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall, then, have more losses soon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, alas!
But to save all we can, the strongest animals must now
have maize and barley; the sickly ones must forage for
themselves till their hour comes. They are certainly
doomed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is barbarous; give them at least something.
Perhaps some may be saved.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;We must be very sparing
with the forage, Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The management of the caravan-bashi was prudent, but
cruel.</p>

<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock the storm came. It was the third
evening we had had violent east winds, a direction exceedingly
infrequent in Tibet. It came like a stroke, and
put an end to all our peacefulness, stopped all conversation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
interfered with all kinds of work, extinguished the camp-fires,
blew sand and dust into my tent, and prevented the
tired animals from grazing; for they will not feed in a
storm. They place themselves with their tails to the wind,
keep all four legs as close together as possible, and hang
their heads. So they remain standing, and wait till it
is quiet again. They had to wait all night long, and
perhaps, sleepy and heavy-headed, dreamed of the heartlessness
of men and the peaceful, sunny slopes at Tankse
and Leh. In the evening Muhamed Isa and I inspected
them. The moon shone brightly, but its cold, bluish light
made the piercing wind seem more icy than usual. The
animals stood, like ghosts, so motionless in the night, that
one would think that they were already turned into ice.
Not the cold, but the wind, kills our horses; all my people
say so. Winter was coming down upon our mountains in
all its severity. The rarefaction of the air and the scanty
pasturage were the worst troubles.</p>

<p>The wind whistled mournfully round the corners as I
went to sleep, and the same sound fell on my ear in the
morning as Tsering, muffled up in a thick fur coat, brought
the brazier in. A dreary morning! Everything in the
tent was buried under a thick layer of dust and drift sand,
and I was thoroughly frozen before I had dressed. The
horses and mules had gone forward eastwards, but I did
not start till nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;in a furious storm. Just outside
the camp the last horse that had perished lay cold and hard
as ice. Tsering told me that he was scarcely a stone&rsquo;s
throw from the body when the wolves had already crept
up to feast on it.</p>

<p>The ground is good, sand, dust, and fine gravel.
Afterwards the soil becomes brick-red. One cannot see
far, the air is hazy and the sky overcast, but as far as the
sight can carry, only low mountains are visible. One or
two brooks, almost frozen up, run out of side valleys on the
north. We slowly ascend to a pass, whence the country
eastwards seems just as level and favourable as hitherto.
Here I am following Rawling&rsquo;s route; his map corresponds
to the actual conditions in the smallest details.</p>

<p>It is quite a different thing to ride against the storm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
over rising ground, and to have the wind on one&rsquo;s back
going downhill. We work our way through the wind,
which penetrates our furs, and in ten minutes are quite
numbed. I can scarcely use my hands for mapping work;
now and then I thrust them into the sleeves of my coat, lean
far forwards, and let the horse find its own way. Two
more horses die before the evening; a third was led
nearly to the camp; he looked fat and sleek, but he
tumbled down.</p>

<p>When I rode into camp I had had more than enough
of this terrible day. A bright fire was burning in the fort
of provision boxes, by which we chatted awhile, waiting
for Tsering. The camp fort shrank up day by day at an
alarming rate, but the animals died so quickly that the
loads were, nevertheless, too heavy. But it was Muhamed
Isa&rsquo;s opinion that enough mules would be left till we got
to the Dangra-yum-tso, and that no baggage need be left
behind. In case of necessity the boat and a couple of
tents might be sacrificed. Empty provision chests were
consumed at once as firewood. Undoubtedly we should
reach the distant lake in a state of utter helplessness.
Without assistance we could proceed no further. Then
the Tibetans could easily stop us. We were therefore a
prey to great anxiety, which increased every day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the animals founder at the same rate as at present,
we shall not reach the nearest nomads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sahib, the strongest are still alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is always your consolation; but in a few
days some of the strongest will be dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wind kills them. If we had only a few days of
calm weather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no prospect of that at this season of the
year. This storm has now lasted 27 hours. Then come
the winter storms from the south-west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On October 1 I wrote in my diary: &ldquo;What will be our
experiences in this new month? At eight o&rsquo;clock the tempest
still raged, and the ride to-day was worse than before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flat, open country. Only one or two hills of red sandstone
and conglomerate with green schist&mdash;otherwise no
hard rock. The Deasy Group, towering to the south,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
seems nearer and nearer. The horse, No. 27, lies in a
pool of frozen blood, cold and bare, for the pack-saddle has
been removed for the sake of the hay. During the night
three horses had stampeded, and were searched for by
Muhamed Isa and three Ladakis. Stupid animals, to tire
themselves out for nothing! Some unaccountable restlessness
seemed to have driven them from the spot where
they were unloaded. The poor things perhaps thought
they could find better grass than our hard-heartedness
allowed them.</p>

<p>We approached a very small freshwater lake, by which
both Wellby and Deasy had rested. A fourth of its surface
was frozen over, and on its west bank the storm had reared
up a wall of ice fragments a foot high. An icy brook
descended from the Deasy Group into the lake. The
water of the lake was cooled down below freezing-point;
a few more hours of perfect calm and the whole lake would
be frozen over. On the bank Sonam Tsering found three
old tent-poles with the iron rings still on them. He could
not remember that Rawling had left them here: probably
they were a memento of Wellby&rsquo;s visit.</p>

<p>Tundup Sonam had killed an antelope, and for my
dinner I was served with fragrant <i>shislik</i> roasted on a spit.
Tsering knew his work; he had been cook to Beach and
Lennart, whom I met in Kashgar in 1890, and was more
skilful than &ldquo;the black fellow,&rdquo; as Muhamed Isa contemptuously
styled the late Manuel.</p>

<p>The Lamaists among my Ladakis told me in confidence
that they prayed every evening to their gods for a lucky
journey. They were just as eager as myself to reach
Shigatse and the holy monastery Tashi-lunpo, where the
Tashi Lama resides. For then they would receive a title
of honour, just as a Mohammedan becomes &ldquo;Hajji&rdquo; when
he has been in Mecca. They would willingly pay their
Peter&rsquo;s pence, seven rupees for butter for the altar lamps,
nay, would give up a whole month&rsquo;s pay as a present to
His Holiness, the Tashi Lama. Their aim was to bring a
pilgrimage to a successful termination; mine to fill up as
many blanks as possible in the map of Tibet. We must
succeed! Heaven befriend us!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p>No one minded that we had not a single man as escort.
Yet with every day we were getting nearer to inhabited
country, and were advancing into a land which had recently
(1904) been at feud with its powerful neighbour on the south.
The Tibetans were ever hostile to Europeans, and after the
slaughter at Guru and Tuna they would probably be still
more bitter against them. We had neither passport nor
permission to enter the forbidden land. How should we
prosper? Our excitement was always increasing. Should
we be received as open enemies, and after all wish ourselves
back with the wolves on the banks of Yeshil-kul?</p>

<p>October 2. Thirty-six degrees of frost in the night&mdash;and
we hear nothing of Rabsang! Has anything happened to
him? Shukkur Ali is sent back along the caravan track with
meat, tea, and bread. A mule, which can no longer keep
on its feet, is killed in the camp. When the wind falls
occasionally, it is singularly quiet. The landscape is still
monotonous&mdash;a boundless, gently rising plain. North and
south the two mountain ranges with their snow-peaks still
run on. Grass and <i>yapkak</i> grow on all sides. Hour after
hour we ride east-north-east without any change of scenery.
I look forward to the moment when we shall turn towards
the south-east, but that is far off, for I must first pass round
all the region that Rawling explored. The animals will
then have still harder work, for we shall have to cross
several passes. The ranges run from east to west; meanwhile
we are marching between two of them, later on we
shall have to go over them. I examine the animals daily
with great anxiety, and fix my hopes on the strongest, the
select troop which will hold out to the last. How depressed
I feel when one of them slips its collar.</p>

<p>At camp No. 28, beside a salt pool, the animals are
mustered as usual. They understand the summons when
the corn-bags are ready. Then they are turned out to
graze. Empty provision sacks and pack-saddles serve
as cloths to protect the animals from the cold at night.
For the mules small triangular pieces are cut to bind over
their foreheads, where they are supposed to be most
susceptible to cold. Outside the Ladakis&rsquo; enclosure stand
our twenty goats and sheep, tied head to head into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
a compact group, so that they may keep one another
warm.</p>

<p>This day the moon rose blood-red over the mountains in
the east. It became quickly paler the higher it rose, and
the snowy mountains shone as white as the steam of an
engine. The evening was calm, and the tent was easily
heated in camp No. 28. Yet the temperature sank to &minus;8°&mdash;and
Rabsang was still missing. Had the wolves torn
him in pieces?</p>

<p>Next morning, however, he turned up in Shukkur Ali&rsquo;s
company, but without the horse. He had followed the
trail of the wandering animal for a long distance, and in
the sand on the shore of the small lake had been able to
read the story of a tragic incident with almost dramatic
vividness. The tracks showed that the horse had galloped
madly about, pursued by a troop of wolves on either side.
They had chased their victim on to a narrow strip of mud
ending in a point. There he had found only one track of
the horse, which disappeared in the slowly deepening bed
of the lake. But the wolves had left a double track&mdash;they
had come back. They thought to fall upon the horse on
the landspit, where he could not run further, but they had
made a mistake. Rabsang maintained that their confusion
was reflected in their backward trail. The helpless horse,
driven to desperation by the wild and hungry jaws opened
wide to devour him, plunged into the water, preferring to
drown rather than fall into the clutches of his persecutors.
Not a drop of blood could be seen. If he had attempted to
swim across the lake, he must have died of cramp; if he had
turned back to the shore, the wolves would have waited
for him and not have retired into the mountains. He was a
hero, and now I felt his loss doubly; he was one of the best
in the caravan, a Sanskari, and had long carried the heaviest
boxes of silver. The picture of his bold spring into the
water, and of his desperation bordering on frenzy, long
haunted my imagination, when I lay awake at night, and I
thought of the horse on which Marcus Curtius plunged
into the abyss.</p>

<p>The day&rsquo;s march took us further along the same even
plain, where at length every trace of vegetation ceased.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
At camp No. 29 there was, alas! no pasturage, and so we
had to lead the horses to the foot of the mountains where
grass grew sparingly.</p>

<p>October 4. We continue our journey to the east-north-east,
and there is not the slightest change in the
country. Like a squirrel in a revolving cage, we go on
and on and yet find ourselves always in the same country;
north and south the same summits appear, and their
profiles change but slowly. Deasy named this great
open longitudinal valley &ldquo;Antelope Plain.&rdquo; Rawling
traversed its south-western portion in two directions, and
my route runs between them on the left bank of its very
broad, but now waterless, drainage channel. We suppose
that the salt lake, which Wellby skirted on the south, must
lie to the east-north-east, but it is not yet visible. Yellow
grass again appears on both sides, and the camp is pitched
beside a small basin of splendid spring-water. As soon as
the animals are relieved of their loads and let loose, we
notice that a third begin to graze at once, another third
stand resting with drooping heads, and the remaining third
lie down immediately. The first are the best and strongest
horses, the last those that are most exhausted. Among
these is horse No. 10, which has to be killed next morning;
he is entered in the list of dead as No. 25.</p>

<p>Muhamed Isa does not now set out before half-past
eight in the morning. He has noticed that the animals
feed with a better appetite in the early hours after sunrise.
The broad, hard river-bed is an excellent road, quite a
highway, descending with an extremely slight gradient.
During the last days the needles of the aneroids have
remained almost stationary at the same figure. To the
north we have still the Kuen-lun, sometimes as masses of
dark rock, sometimes with snow-capped, rounded summits.</p>

<p>At one o&rsquo;clock I always make a short halt with Robert
and Rehim Ali to read the meteorological instruments.
The journal is kept by Robert with the greatest care. I
draw a panorama and take bearings, while our horses stray
about grazing. We take no food at that time, for we eat
only twice a day&mdash;at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning and six in
the evening. Yet the short mid-day rest is very welcome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
We are by that time thoroughly frozen; we can more
easily keep ourselves warm on the ground than in the
saddle, where we are fully exposed to the wind.</p>

<p>We have not seen a drop of water all day long, and the
caravan is evidently looking for a spring, for we see scouts
making off from time to time to the right and left. At
length they discover a large pond, and there the tents are
set up. We have marched lately about nine miles a day&mdash;we
cannot do more.</p>

<p>We had scarcely set out on the morning of October 6
when the camping-ground was inspected by wolves on the
look-out for another horse. They follow us as faithfully as
the ravens, and perhaps receive reinforcements from time
to time. Strict orders are issued that the night watch
must be responsible for the animals, and will be punished
if we suffer any loss from the wolves. The six ravens also
still stick to us. They settle when we encamp, they set
out with us, and follow us all day long with their hoarse
croaking.</p>

<p>We pass over the river-bed, now containing water and
ice, but still the low hills hide the expected lake. Otherwise
the ground is level, so level that only the languid
movement of the stream shows in which direction the land
dips. Yellow sand-whirls in the north-west indicate the
approach of a storm, which comes upon us out of a clear
sky. Within half an hour it passes into an easterly storm,
a typical cyclone. Worn out with the cold we arrive at
camp No. 32.</p>

<p>The puppies are now quite big, and up to all kinds of
mischief. It is recorded against the white puppy that she
has torn up one of my map-sheets. Fortunately, none of
the fragments is wanting. Tsering also found a toothbrush
in front of my tent, which the silly dog must have
considered superfluous. The brown puppy bit in two a
hydrometer, which was lying about in its leathern case.
Their education is very defective, but they are foundlings
from the streets of Srinagar, and we cannot therefore
expect much of them. They have not the slightest notion
of discipline, and they do not obey when they are called.
But when Tsering brings the dinner they come to heel at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
once, put on a show of amiability, and force themselves to
the front by some means or other. They are not of much
use; they keep my feet warm at night, for then they lie
rolled up together on my bed.</p>

<p>Forty-five degrees of frost in the night! That was
perhaps why I had such a horrid dream: a whole host of
dark Tibetans came to meet us, and drove us back to the
north. The water in the basin and the ink are lumps
of ice.</p>

<p>Now we have left Rawling far behind us, and Wellby
and Malcolm&rsquo;s is the last route which has been traversed in
this region. We are still following the same valley as that
expedition.</p>

<p>Our store of yak meat was just at an end when Tundup
Sonam killed an antelope. A second, unfortunately, he
only wounded, and it escaped on three legs. One of our
wolves was pacing about on a hill. He had closely watched
the chase, and the wounded animal would probably become
his prey.</p>

<p>Muhamed Isa, in his thick grey winter suit and with
his pipe in his mouth, moves about, and is guiding the
caravan up between the hills when we overtake him. We
ascend to the summit of a hill. A white line appears, and
below it a bluish-green stripe which gradually increases in
dimensions. After a few minutes we have the salt lake we
have been looking for immediately below us, for the hills
slope steeply to the southern shore. Now the Ladakis
commence one of their finest march songs in soft, melting
tones; they are glad to have reached this lake which I
have spoken of constantly, and, like myself, remind themselves
that we have reached another stage on the long
journey to Dangra-yum-tso. To the north-west the scenery
is grand, with the great mountains, their snow-capped peaks
and great glaciers. Continuing the direction of the sea
westwards is flat land white with salt, and there white
eddies dance, whirling along the dismal shore.</p>

<p>East-north-east the longitudinal valley is as open as
before; there Wellby travelled. We can now, if we
wish, turn aside to the south-east without again coming in
contact with Rawling&rsquo;s route. There new country awaits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
us, the great triangle between Wellby&rsquo;s, Bower&rsquo;s, and
Dutreuil de Rhins&rsquo; routes. It had been one of my most
cherished hopes to cross, at least once, the great white
patch which bears on the English map of Tibet nothing but
the one word &ldquo;Unexplored.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span></p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:298px; height:30px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img0.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XII</p>

<p class="center chap2">IN UNKNOWN COUNTRY</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> the middle of the night I was awaked by seven mules,
which stood close to my tent stamping about on its ropes.
I went out to drive them away, but when I saw how
piteously cold they were, and how closely they crowded
together, I let them alone. One of them lay dead in the
morning beside my tent, with its belly swollen all out of
shape.</p>

<p>Green schists form small ledges and strips on the otherwise
soft ground, so that at a distance the land seems
striped with black. Here and there veins of quartz crop
out. Reddish-purple hills appear on the western horizon,
and the country becomes more uneven. After a while we
pass the sheep driven by the men in the wake of the
caravan. They travel very slowly, grazing as they go; we
have still 18 left. To-day the water is a difficulty. Some
is found by digging at a depth of a foot, but it is briny.
The day&rsquo;s march is therefore longer than usual, 12 miles,
but then we come to a spring.</p>

<p>On the eve of a day of rest we feel as though it were
Saturday evening and there were no school next day. We
intended to spend October 9 in camp No. 34; I had not
given a day&rsquo;s rest for 17 days. All were delighted, and the
Ladakis, in anticipation of the day of rest, arranged an <i>al
fresco</i> feast round a great camp-fire. The refreshments
were the same as usual: tea in wooden bowls, parched
meal, and roasted antelope meat&mdash;spirituous liquors of any
kind were prohibited in our caravan. But, nevertheless, the
men were in a right jovial mood; they danced round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
fire, and sang a lively song with a chorus culminating in
barbaric, shrill-sounding laughter. They rejoiced that they
had proceeded so far and still possessed sufficient power of
resistance to undergo severe hardships. We have travelled
331 miles from the Karakorum, and there are 400 more to
the Dangra-yum-tso. But we are nearer the lake than we
are to Leh, and so have really more than half the journey
behind us.</p>

<p>After 41 degrees of frost in the night, October 10 dawned
with brilliant weather, sunny and calm. Horse No. 3 was
the twenty-sixth martyr of the caravan; he lay dead on
the field. We passed another which was reduced to a
skeleton and never reached the camp. We travelled east-south-east,
and had now to leave the longitudinal valley
through which Wellby had traversed the whole of north
Tibet. A small hollow in the ground was crossed, and the
camp was pitched among the hills on its south side. The
brown puppy had behaved so disgracefully that she had to
lie outside as a punishment. She howled and whined
piteously, but slept after she had been covered with a
frieze rug. Next day she had to travel with the mules to
her shame. In the night another horse died.</p>

<p>Red and yellowish-grey hills begirt the way, which led
up in three hours to a small flat saddle, whence the view
eastwards seemed boundless. Had it been our intention to
proceed farther in this direction we should have encountered
no difficulties in the nature of the ground for many days to
come, but my unalterable goal was the Dangra-yum-tso,
and therefore we must direct our course south-eastwards.
There a dark chain with an irregular, toothed crest soon
came into view. Between its summits were seen deeply-cut
saddle-formed gaps; but, to our chagrin, they were
more difficult to surmount than they appeared, and the
slightest rise in the ground was felt by our caravan in its
prostrate condition.</p>

<p>The ground was all honeycombed with the holes of the
abominable field-mice, but the holes were not so treacherous
now, for the soil was frozen, and held firm when we rode
over the subterranean catacombs connected by a network
of passages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span></p>

<p>Again we mounted a small swell in the ground (17,234 feet).
We saw before us a dark point in the track of the caravan;
it was a dead mule, which slept his last sleep with wide-open
eyes beside his pack-saddle. Behind a hill we surprised a
large, handsome fox, which made off in a great hurry as
we drew near. But he could not refrain from frequently
turning round and staring at us; he had probably never
seen a human being before.</p>

<p>At camp No. 36 there was not a drop of water, but we
were not able to travel further. We had with us two
goat&rsquo;s leather bottles filled with ice which sufficed for our
tea; but the animals had to go without water. However,
we could not complain; it was the first time since Leh that
we had had no water.</p>

<p>An unusual sight greeted us on the morning of October
12; the whole country was covered with snow. But
scarcely had the sun mounted up, when the snow melted
and the ground was dry. The caravan set out early for the
sake of the thirsty animals. Now we kept on a south-easterly
course, leaving out of the range of our vision the
lake discovered by Rawling, and named &ldquo;Lake Markham&rdquo;
after the former distinguished President of the Royal
Geographical Society in London.</p>

<p>Again we pass a horse with its throat cut; it is reddish-brown,
and contrasts strongly with the grey, sandy soil.
The eyes have already been picked out by the six ravens
which sit like black ghouls round the fallen beast and hold a
wake. A little farther something suspicious again appears
in the track of the caravan&mdash;it is the sixth mule. He has
collapsed on the march and has not to be killed; he is still
soft and warm, and his eyes have not lost their brightness,
but the ravens will soon be here, for they follow the
caravan like dolphins in the wake of a vessel. For every
animal that falls there is a horse-cloth to spare for his
comrades. They will need it when the severe cold of
winter comes. The two victims to-day have long been
released from duty, but they had to follow on till they
died, for there was always a hope that they would recover&mdash;a
vain one, indeed.</p>

<p>The trail leads us to the mouth of a valley, where we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
soon come up with the caravan&mdash;all the animals have their
heads in a brook, they have had to thirst so long. The valley
must come down from a pass, so we march up it. It becomes
narrower and narrower, till at length there is a passage only
five yards broad between walls of schists tilted up vertically.
By the brook lay the bleached skull of an Ammon sheep
with fine horns (Illustrations 59, 60). We found shelter
from the cutting wind at the foot of a precipitous wall of
rock on the left side of the valley, and there set up our tent
poles. Muhamed Isa climbed a height opposite, taking
the field-glass. &ldquo;A labyrinth of small mountains,&rdquo; was his
unsatisfactory report. By this time we had lost 29 horses
and 6 mules, and had only 29 horses and 30 mules. &ldquo;The
strongest animals are still living,&rdquo; was Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s
consolation.</p>

<p>October 13. The night with 39 degrees of frost deprived
us of another horse and a mule. Their bones are bleaching
in camp No. 37, and are tokens of our visit. A heavy
march over very undulating ground. We had to cross
over three small, trying passes. A good deal of snow still
lay on the ground. To our right extended a red mountain
crest, and in a gorge a waterfall was congealed into a mass
of ice. Muhamed Isa had erected three cairns to show us
the way where the track of the caravan became indistinct
on pebbly ground. On the first pass the prospect was
dreary, nothing but pink, purple, and yellow mountains.
On the north the Turkestan mountains still dominated the
landscape with their majestic peaks, a row of imperial
crowns far above the rest. Fifty degrees east of north we
fancied we perceived a large lake, but it might equally well
be a plain transfigured by the mirage. Many of the hills
and spurs consist of creeping soil from above, which in
consequence of its slow motion is frozen into concentric
rings and other patterns. The third pass rises in perfectly
barren land. Here Tsering gave himself enormous trouble
in setting up a cairn, which was quite unnecessary, for no
one would come after us; but it was an act of homage to
the gods of the mountains, an earnest prayer that they would
let us pass safely.</p>

<p>At last we came down into open country, a main valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
running eastwards, where there was a glimpse of yellow
grass in the distance. Tundup Sonam shot two Ammon
sheep, and their flesh prolonged the lives of our 18 sheep.
In this cold, windy weather we are never properly warm.
When I sit, sketching the panorama of the mountains or
taking a solar observation, I must have the brazier beside
me to warm my numbed hands a little, so that I can use
them. Only Muhamed Isa, Tsering, Sonam Tsering, and
Guffaru are exempt from night duty; all the rest are
obliged to turn out into the cold, dark, wintry night.
When darkness falls I fill up the drawings I have sketched
in the day, study maps, or read light literature, or Supan&rsquo;s
<i>Physische Erdkunde</i>, and a couple of books on Buddhism
and Lamaism. At nine o&rsquo;clock Robert takes meteorological
readings, and sets up the hypsometer, which I read
off in my tent. Then we talk awhile and go to sleep. My
bed is laid on an India-rubber sheet and two folded
Turkestan frieze blankets. On these is laid a great square of
goatskins sewed together. I lay myself down on one
half of the square and cover myself with the other, and
then Tsering tucks in the edges under the felt blankets,
so that the whole is converted into a sack. Lastly, he
spreads two more felt blankets, my ulster, and my fur
coat over me. I have my fur cap on my head and a
<i>bashlik</i>; otherwise I undress as usual. In stormy weather
the morning bath is not exactly pleasant; my clothes have
become icy cold during the night. The Ladakis have no
notion of cleanliness, and consequently carry about with
them small colonies of vermin, for which I have not the
least use. But those who make my bed, clear up, and
wait on me in my tent, cannot help giving me a most
liberal share of their surplus, and therefore my underclothing
has to be frequently washed in boiling water.
My sensitiveness in this respect is a wonderful source of
amusement to the Ladakis; I hear them laughing heartily
at my horror of all kinds of blood-sucking creatures. But
I tell them that I feel comfortable only when I am quite
alone in my clothes.</p>

<p>The winter evenings grew longer and longer, and our
life passed in monotonous solitude. The worst was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
my light reading was put a stop to. To occupy the leisure
hours I made the Ladakis relate to me traditions and
legends of their own country, and noted some of them down.
I also made each of my servants narrate his own experiences;
but the notes I made of them were not very remarkable,
for the men had not much to tell, and thought it all quite
natural and unimportant. You must question and draw
them out, and even then the result is unsatisfactory. They
very seldom know the name of a European whom they
have served for months, and they cannot state their own
age. But they know exactly how many horses there were
in a caravan they accompanied years ago, and the colour of
each horse. One Ladaki, who has traversed the inhabited
parts of western Tibet, can tell me the name of every
camping-ground, describe it accurately, and tell me whether
the pasture there was good or bad. They have also a
marvellous memory for the character of the ground.</p>

<p>Having regard to the compass of this narrative, I
cannot allow myself to wander into diffuse biographical
notices, but I must very briefly introduce my little party
to the reader. We will begin, then, with Rabsang, who
went in search of the horse that was baited by the wolves.
He is a Bod, or Buddhist, strictly speaking a Lamaist;
his father is named Pale, his mother Rdugmo, from the
village Chushut-yogma in Ladak. By occupation he is a
<i>zemindar</i> or farmer, grows barley, wheat, and peas, owns
two horses and two yaks, but no sheep, pays 23 rupees
(about 31 shillings) in taxes to the Maharaja, but no contributions
to the lamas. Once a year he travels in the
service of Afghan merchants to Yarkand, and receives 50
rupees for the whole journey. The merchants carry
clothing materials, coral, tea, indigo, etc., to Yarkand,
where they put up in the <i>serai</i> of the Hindus, and stay
twenty days to sell their goods and purchase silk, felt
rugs, ordinary rugs, etc., which they get rid of in Peshawar.
Rabsang had served chiefly the Hajji Eidar Khan, a rich
merchant of Cabul. Six years ago he had an adventure on
the Suget-davan, where twelve Badakshan men, who owed
the Hajji money, met the caravan. The twelve men had
led a wild life in Yarkand, and could not pay their debts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
The Afghans, who numbered five, fell upon them and a
violent scuffle ensued, ending in bloodshed. That was Rabsang&rsquo;s
worst adventure. He had served Captain Deasy five
months and another Englishman as long. When he was
away himself, his wife and a brother tilled his land and looked
after his affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you depend on your wife&rsquo;s faithfulness for so long
a time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but we do not think much of that
in Ladak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens if she misconducts herself with another
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he must give me a sheep as compensation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this not a word more could be extracted from Rabsang.</p>

<p>In our caravan he is under Tsering&rsquo;s immediate command,
and leads the four horses which carry my tent, my
bed, the four boxes of articles for daily use, and the kitchen
utensils. He is assistant to the head cook, and has to keep
me supplied all the evening with fuel. He brings Tsering
fuel and water for cooking, and is an exceedingly sturdy,
useful fellow. A year later he had a prominent part to
play.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the Mohammedan Rehim Ali.
He is my right-hand man on the march. Guffaru is the
oldest of the company, and guide of the horse caravan;
consequently the more horses die, the less he has to do.
The Hajji Gulam Razul has been twice in Mecca; he is
Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s cook. Shukkur Ali has made many
remarkable journeys, which would fill a whole chapter
themselves; with us he is leader of a section of the
horse caravan, but has now only two charges. Gaffar is
a young Mohammedan, who follows the horses, gathers
fuel, and fetches water. Young Tsering has the same
occupations, and Ishe, Tundup, and Adul belong also to
this party; the last, a hard-working, sturdy man, has
entered my service in order to buy himself a house in Leh
and to enable him to marry. Islam Ahun is horse watchman.
Bolu belongs to my caravan, and is one of Tsering&rsquo;s
assistants. Galsan, who has travelled much in western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
Tibet, serves as a mule-driver. Ishe Tundup is responsible
for the sheep. Lobsang Rigdal, nicknamed the Lama,
has to attend to my horses. He is come with me to earn
money to give to his father and elder brother, because they
have always taken good care of him. He is the jester of
the caravan, and has a very comical appearance. Tashi,
who accompanies the horses, is one of our best men.
Tundup Sonam keeps up the sporting reputation of the
caravan and provides us all with fresh meat. He
scarcely ever misses, and is as quiet and composed as a
pan of clotted milk. He had served under me before, in
the winter of 1902, when I travelled from Leh to Yarkand.
Gartyung belongs to the mule caravan, and entered my
service to restore order in his financial affairs. A small,
short, black-bearded fellow, fifty years of age, answers to
the name of Tashi Tsering; formerly he was called Islam
Ahun, he says, so he has changed his religion, though it
seldom happens that a Mohammedan goes over to Lamaism.
He also leads a troop of horses. Rub Das is a Gurkha
from Sitang, and does all sorts of work; he is silent
and works like a slave, without needing the slightest
reminder. Tundup Geltsan is the reciter of tales, whose
voice is heard when all the day&rsquo;s work is over; he is also
chief cook in the black tent of the Ladakis. Namgyal is
a mule-driver, and one of our best; Sonam Tsering is
overseer of the mules, Kurban nothing but Guffaru&rsquo;s son,
and Tsering is my head cook.</p>

<p>Herewith the list closes. Each of these men had his
duty to perform; all were willing and good tempered, and
quarrels and disputes were never heard. But Robert and
Muhamed Isa knew excellently well how to maintain discipline.
Every man had a warm sheepskin, and they made
themselves bedding of the skins of the slaughtered sheep or
the wild animals that were shot; as the winter cold abated
they used empty provision sacks as blankets. As they
all travelled on foot they soon wore out their soft Ladak
boots, and they had to re-sole them repeatedly; for that
purpose they utilized pieces of skin with the wool turned
inwards.</p>

<p>On October 14 we passed a series of large river-beds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
which intersect the ridge to the south along flattish valleys.
Kulans and antelopes were grazing in large numbers.
At the camp, situated between reddish hills, the grass was
good. Our direction was east-south-east. In the night a
horse died. The country preserves henceforth the same
character: it consists of a number of small ridges extending
from east to west, and much time is lost in crossing them;
between them lie longitudinal valleys. Not infrequently we
can count southwards three or four such ridges, and we
have to pass over them all. We have lost ourselves in a sea
of rigid undulations; we are like a ship that has lost its
rudder and is on the point of sinking: no islands of refuge,
no ships coming to meet us, boundless sea on all sides.
We should like to pour oil on this rough sea; we long for
calm waterways, but as long as a plank remains we will
cling fast to it. At camp No. 40 there was good grazing,
and water we could obtain from ice.</p>

<p>The men have sewed up a felt coat for the brown
puppy, which they put on her when it is cold at night.
She looks very ridiculous in her new night-dress when she
runs about, steps on a corner, and then rolls over. The
white puppy sits at first quite disconcerted and gazes at
her, but then finds the sight so alluring that she cannot
refrain from making fun of her comrade, dancing about her
and biting her cloak. The brown one, on the other hand,
sits resolutely quiet and lets the white one sport about her.</p>

<p>We penetrate further into the forbidden land. On
October 16, the anniversary of my departure from Stockholm,
we had still 380 miles to travel to Dangra-yum-tso, but now
were seldom able to march more than 7½ miles a day. In
Camp No. 41 (Illustration 65) some articles that we could spare
were left behind, to lighten the loads, among them several
books that I had read and Bower&rsquo;s narrative, which had
now served their turn in my travelling library. The tents
were set up in a sheltered valley at the foot of a rock.
Tundup Sonam had gone in advance, and had surprised a
four-year-old yak which was lying on a slope in the sun.
Taking advantage of inequalities in the ground, the sportsman
had crept up quite close to it. The first ball had
entered the pelvis. The yak, thus unpleasantly aroused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
from his meditation, sprang up and received a second bullet
in his hough. Then he rushed down the slope, turned a
somersault on to the bottom of the valley, and lay dead as
a mouse; and here, therefore, the tents were pitched. He
was already skinned and cut up when we arrived, and the
dark-red flesh with a purplish tint at the legs lay in the sun.
The stomach was immense, and full of grass, lichen, and
moss&mdash;no wonder that the animal needed rest after such
gourmandizing. The head was set up as a decoration at
the foot of a mountain spur, and the hunter was photographed
beside this trophy. The Ladakis were ordered to
eat their fill of the meat, for we could not burden ourselves
with any extra weight. All the fat, however, was taken
with us, and the marrow was reserved for me. When we
left the place, there was not much left of the yak, and I have
my suspicion that the Ladakis carried some fine pieces with
them in their private bags.</p>

<p>The ravens, in company with an eagle, sat feasting
round the bloody skeleton. Now there are eleven of them,
and their wings shine in the sun like blue steel. They feel,
alas! quite at home in the caravan and are half tame. The
dogs take no notice of them, and are treated by the ravens
with sarcastic contempt.</p>

<p>October 17 was a trying day; there was a strong wind
from the west, and the temperature did not rise above 23°
at noon. We were approaching a pass, but we encamped
before reaching the summit. At nine o&rsquo;clock the thermometer
marked 9.3°, and I could make it rise in the tent
only to 24.5°, for the little warmth radiating from the
brazier was at once driven out by the wind. The minimum
thermometer stood at &minus;18.8°, the lowest temperature
that we had hitherto recorded. A white mule,
which had carried no load for the past ten days, was frozen
to death. Now I had 27 mules, 27 horses, and 27 servants
in the caravan. We had not seen a man for 57 days.
Should we all remain together till we fell in with the first
nomads?</p>

<p>Antelopes and yaks were grazing on the slopes of the
pass, the height of which is 17,575 feet. A labyrinth of
mountains spreads itself out in the direction of our march,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
and therefore we turn aside to the north-east and encamp
in the mouth of a valley. The white puppy, which faithfully
follows Robert and myself, is always soundly thrashed
by her brown sister when we arrive in camp. She has no
hope of defending herself, so she lies quietly on her back as
if she were made of papier maché, and does not dare to utter
a sound. Now they are both bloated from over-indulgence
in yak flesh; but however bad the brown puppy
may feel, her little sister must get her licking as soon as
she appears.</p>

<p>In the night of October 19 two more of our horses were
frozen to death, and a sheep. Of the latter we had now only
16; puffed up with gas the three dead animals lay on the
slope and stared at us with dark blood-stained eye-cavities;
the ravens had already been at them. The ground was
very difficult, constantly sloping upwards and then down
again. We saw the caravan struggle up to a pass, but
beyond appeared another still higher, with patches of snow.
The crests of the mountains in this country run in general
to the east-north-east. In the south lies a lake at a distance
of about 20 miles, but it is far to the right of our route.</p>

<p>When we reached camp No. 44, at a height of 17,539
feet, in the midst of terrible mountains, it was announced
that Muhamed Isa was ill. He had suffered for some days
with severe headache, and had been well dosed with quinine.
As he could not reconnoitre as usual, Robert asked permission
to climb the high pass which barred the way to the
east, and to look around. He did not come back till dark,
and then informed us that we should soon emerge from
these troublesome mountains if we turned to the south-east.
Muhamed Isa therefore received instructions for the following
day in accordance with this information.</p>

<p>What a difference from the previous evening when the
stars twinkled down from a blue-black sky and the fires
blazed bright and red! Now heavy masses of cloud lie
over mountain and valley, so low that they seem almost
within reach of the hand. It snows unusually thickly; the
ground is white, and the inequalities and tufts of moss throw
long shadows about the fires. A pale light rises out of the
provision fortress, now reduced to small dimensions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
casts a feeble glow on the black tent of the Ladakis.
Tsering sits with his men round the kitchen fire, wrapped
in furs, and delivers a lecture more than two hours long,
without pausing a second. His tongue is like a windmill
in a breeze. They have all known one another for years.
What on earth can he have to tell them that they have not
heard already twenty times over? But Rabsang, Rehim
Ali, and a couple of other men listen attentively, and
express their satisfaction from time to time. I join them
for a while. They rise to greet me, and lay a fresh armful
of dry dung cakes on the fire. The flickering flames throw
a glaring light over the snow, which crunches under the feet
of the men. But the brightness does not extend far, and,
beyond, the darkness of night yawns on all sides. The
grazing animals can neither be seen nor heard, but the
snow hisses as it falls continuously into the blaze of the
yak-dung fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span></p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p class="center chap2">UNFORTUNATE DAYS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">October</span> 20, 1906, was a bad day. The snow lay three
inches deep, and all around was dazzling white in the sunshine;
only to the west blue shadows spread over the
slopes. We were to cross the pass. In the universal whiteness
the distance seemed short, but after the caravan had
advanced half way, the pass still appeared as a small,
black, fixed point. The field-mice were awake and
scurried about between their holes in the snow, which
became deeper as the way became steeper. It was soon
a foot deep, and we had to keep carefully in the track of
the caravan, lest we should roll over into the snowy abyss.
Spots of blood were seen; one of the animals had hurt its
foot against the sharp-edged detritus. Step by step we
mount upwards, blue-black clouds gather threateningly
together behind us, and in an instant we are enveloped in
the wildest driving snow: the dry particles, fine as flour,
whirl round us, like comet tails, with a rushing sound.
They collect into drifts, the track of the caravan is hidden,
and we can no longer see how far it is still to this deadly
pass.</p>

<p>A dead horse lies on the way, without its eyes&mdash;the
wicked ravens must always have the eyes while they are
still warm and soft. The wind had driven the snow over
his back and neck, as though to make him a nice and
comfortable couch. He lay as on a bed of state, exposed
to all the winds of heaven, with clean white pall, and the
black ravens as a guard of honour&mdash;the only thanks he got
for his services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span></p>

<p>On the pass we make the usual halt for observations;
the height is 18,409 feet; it blows and snows, with 18 degrees
of cold. We perceive, however, some sign of the saddle
to the south-east which Robert reconnoitred yesterday, and
which is supposed to lead down into level country. But
Muhamed Isa has taken his own way down a valley
running north-east, and that is serious for us. Far in
front as he is, we must, though much against our will,
follow his track, lest we should lose one another. It is
now difficult to see whither the caravan had marched. If
we lose one another in such country, and the snow continues
to fall, we are done for.</p>

<p>So we follow him down the valley. The pass behind
us looks weird&mdash;a white saddle against a background of
blue-black clouds, which resemble whirling, suffocating
smoke. Tsering reaches the pass with his two men and
four horses, and salutes it with a loud salaam. Treacherous
frozen rivulets are crossed, as hard as glass and as smooth
as cooling grease; our riding horses stumble and slide.
It is very seldom that a small hill of dark schist peeps out
above the snow.</p>

<p>As the valley runs too much to the north, the caravan
perceives its mistake, turns aside to the east, and buries
itself in a labyrinth of hills where not a blade of grass
grows. We ride past the shepherd with the 16 sheep and
the goats; the white puppy teases them as usual, till a
bold wether puts her to flight. The goats are remarkably
hardy and get on splendidly, and yield me a cup of milk
every morning and evening.</p>

<p>We found the caravan behind a second saddle. The
camp was formed, but in a most unfavourable spot; there
was neither grass nor <i>yapkak</i>, neither dung nor water&mdash;absolutely
nothing. The animals stood in a dark group,
standing out sharply against the white snow. Thus they
had to stand, quietly and patiently, all night long, and
doubtless felt how slowly the time passed, how hunger and
thirst increased, and the cold again diminished. They had
to wait standing for the morning red, which might perhaps
fail to appear, for dark masses of cloud still covered the
sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span></p>

<p>Robert and I took refuge in the tent of the Ladakis,
where a fire burned, which was fed with fragments of a box
and antelope dung. We could at any rate obtain water
by melting snow; my dinner consisted of parched meal,
bread, and coffee, for nothing else could be cooked. In the
twilight Rabsang appeared and asked me to come outside.
Two large wild yaks stood on a neighbouring hill and
gazed at our camp with astonishment. But we left them in
peace, for we did not want their flesh, and would not add
to our loads. They trotted slowly away when they were
convinced that we were not of their species. The night
was pitch dark, so that I had to inspect our weary beasts
with a lantern.</p>

<p>We set out early from this unlucky camp, where a mule
had fallen at his post. The footprints between the tents,
made in the snow the evening before, were filled up with
fresh snow, and a new set of paths had been formed.
Scarcely two minutes&rsquo; walk from the camp a horse lay dead,
which had carried his load only the day before, and the
black corpse-watch was beside it. A dead wild-duck also
lay in the snow. Is there a lake in the neighbourhood?
No; the ducks come long distances, and this one had
probably lost its way.</p>

<p>Now the sun burns, now a snowstorm envelops us in
its fine dust, now we are roasted, now chilled through&mdash;regular
Tibetan weather, unreliable and changeable.
Another dead horse! The men had cut its throat to
shorten its sufferings; swiftly whirling snow covers the
stream of blood that congeals in the cold. We make our
way up to a pass, and then follow a ridge, but the ground
is frightful. At length we ride down a flat valley which
gradually winds round to the north; on the south rises a
formidable crest. Muhamed Isa had orders to take, if
possible, a south-easterly direction, but as he was not sure
of the way, he had encamped at the bend of the road. He
had gone forwards with two men to reconnoitre. Towards
four o&rsquo;clock he returned, and reported that we should reach
open country within three hours. My first thought was to
set out at once, for in camp No. 46 there was no grass,
and the animals were so hungry that they bit one another&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
tails and the pack-saddles. One horse had actually not a
hair left on his tail, but that one had been eaten up the
night before. The old, experienced hands, however, gave
their opinion that it would be better to start in the early
morning.</p>

<p>I therefore gave orders to reserve as much rice as we
should require for forty days, and to give the rest, mixed
with barley and maize, to the animals. While, however,
they were eating from their nose-bags, the men changed
their minds, and Muhamed Isa asked if they might make a
start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite willing, but it will be pitch dark in an
hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find the way. You have only to follow the trail
in the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then began the tumult of breaking up camp, and the
sound of tramping in the snow; but there was no singing.
There were 27 degrees of frost with a boisterous wind from
the west. Everything was taken except my things and
Robert&rsquo;s and the cooking utensils. A mule, which refused
to move, remained with us. No fires lighted up the dark
procession led by the horses and closed by the sheep. It
moved off slowly, and the shouts of the men reached us
more and more feebly till at length the caravan disappeared
in the pale moonlight. I entered my tent stiff with cold.
A quarter of an hour later a man came back with another
mule which could not get on any further. So we had two
dying animals with us.</p>

<p>And then came the night. The air was clear and calm,
the stars twinkled like diamonds in the brightness of electric
light, and the cold settled keenly round our tent. Outside,
Tsering, Rabsang, Rehim Ali, and Bolu had rolled themselves
together into a heap under all their belongings. As
long as I was awake I heard the irrepressible Tsering
telling his tales in the depth of his cave of furs, and the
others occasionally giving vent to a subterranean giggle.
Curious fellows, these Ladakis! No amount of cold seems
to affect them, while I, in my tent, can only sleep a minute
at a time.</p>

<p>An awful, terrible night in the lonely mountains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
Tibet. The temperature sank to &minus;17°, and that was too
much for the two mules which had been left behind. One
expired about midnight; he was the animal which Sonam
Tsering had wished on the first day to send back to Leh as
useless. We tried then to exchange him for a horse, but
as no one would have him, he had to come with us after all.
He was accustomed to travel with horses, and later on
always went with them. To the astonishment of all he
became strong and led the van&mdash;a good example for
the horses. Now he lay cold and hard as iron, with his
legs stretched out; if he had been lifted on to his feet
he would have remained standing. Sonam Tsering wept
when he heard that the animal was gone.</p>

<p>The other mule was heard moving about in the night
and nibbling at the yak grass, which is too short for other
animals except the yak; the tongue of the yak is provided
with horny barbs which pluck up the fine velvety grass.
Early in the morning I heard the mule squeal, and was
glad that one at least still survived. But when the sun
rose his strength too was spent, and when Tsering woke me
he said that the animal was dying. He looked healthy and
well nourished, but we tried in vain to raise him up and
feed him with maize, and he was sacrificed to the gods of
this valley of death. He did not move a limb or twitch an
eyelid as the blood spurted out on to the snow; he seemed
only to experience a welcome sense of peace and resignation,
while his eyes were turned full on the sun.</p>

<p>As we were on the point of leaving this horrible camp,
there came fresh tidings of misfortune. Tundup Sonam
appeared to show us the way, and reported that the horse
caravan had wandered off too far to the left, while the mules
under Muhamed Isa had taken the opposite direction.
Muhamed Isa, as soon as he found out his mistake, had
descended into the first valley he could find, to wait there
for the dawn. As for the flock of sheep, Tundup Sonam
could only say that it had at first followed the track of the
horses, but had afterwards turned away. The greatest
confusion reigned everywhere, but the worst news Tundup
Sonam kept to the last: four more mules had died during
the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span></p>

<p>Our situation was desperate. We could not go on
much longer; we were coming to a crisis. The ground,
the weather, and the cold were all against us, the horses
died wholesale, and it might be a hopeless distance to the
nearest nomads. What did it matter whether the Tibetans
would be friendly or hostile? Now the only question was:
should we be able to drag ourselves along to inhabited districts?
For, if these losses continued a few days longer,
we should soon be compelled to abandon all the baggage
and continue our journey on foot. But could we carry
ourselves enough provisions to last us through this uninhabited
country? Should we perish one after another in
these icy deserts of the Tibetan Alps? And if at length,
in a wretched, half-dead condition, we met with Tibetans,
they could do what they liked with us. At any rate we
could not force our way through to Shigatse and the unknown
country to the north of the Tsangpo, the goal of all
my most cherished dreams.</p>

<p>A journey straight across Tibet looks pleasant and easy
on the map. In reality it is a serious and difficult undertaking,
costing suffering, excitement, and tears. The
meandering line is drawn in red on the map, for it is really
marked with blood. We set out under the guidance of
Tundup Sonam, and it soon became evident that we
should never have found the way without him. Up and
down, over hills and through valleys we threaded this
intricate maze, where the deep snow smoothed down the
inequalities and quite misled us in estimating the heights
of the steep declivities. We left the track of the horses on
our left; there a load of maize was left, but Tundup Sonam
assured me it would be fetched. To the right appeared
the high ground where the mules had wandered in the
night trying their strength uselessly. An icy south-west
wind blew over the bitterly cold snowfields. From time
to time Tundup Sonam reared up a slab of schist to show
the way to Tsering, who was coming behind without a
guide.</p>

<p>Now we cross the trail of the mules and see the valley
where they have passed the night. &ldquo;Yonder, on the slope,
lies a mule,&rdquo; says Tundup Sonam, &ldquo;and two behind the hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
and a little farther on a fourth.&rdquo; We could not see them
from where we were, but the ravens resting here, sleepy
and satiated, confirmed his words.</p>

<p>At last we reached the pass, whence we caught sight of
the plain and a small lake to the south-east. The height
was 18,048 feet. At one o&rsquo;clock there were 18 degrees of frost,
the wind was high, and it snowed so thickly that the view
disappeared again. We did not stay a minute longer than
was necessary for observations, and then rode down a steep
descent. We rested at the first grass we came to; the
horses were almost mad with delight when they saw it&mdash;their
stomachs were so empty.</p>

<p>Now we saw five men on a height. They were Muhamed
Isa and four companions, who had come out
to look for the missing men and animals&mdash;14 horses,
8 men, 16 sheep, and 2 dogs. We were able to inform them
that their track ran north-eastwards, and after they had
given directions how to find the camping-ground of the
mules they vanished again in the snow. After searching
in vain for the track and looking out for the smoke of the
camp-fire, we came to a halt on a smooth plateau, where
the grazing was good, and collected dung for a fire&mdash;it
was high time, for Robert and I were half dead with cold.</p>

<p>We were in a terribly sad plight. We did not know
where the mules were encamping, and had not the
slightest notion where the horses had gone. The sheep, in
this country swarming with wolves, were probably lost.
Tsering had remained behind, and might easily miss our
track in the snowstorm. We could do nothing but thaw
our clothes. After we had been sitting an hour, and had
somewhat recovered in the heat of the fire, the &ldquo;Lama&rdquo;
came over the plain bringing with him Sonam Tsering, who
had been camping with the mules behind some hills.
The good fellow wept bitterly at our losses; Muhamed Isa
had proved a bad pilot this time, he complained. Nine
mules had perished within a few hours in these frightful
mountains, which were probably the western prolongation
of the system called by the Mongols, dwelling farther to the
east, Buka-magna, or the &ldquo;Head of the Wild Yak.&rdquo;
Twenty mules still remained, but two of them had received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
their death-warrant. Of the twenty-three surviving horses
one was left behind with his pack-saddle in a hollow, and was
probably dead by this time. At a late hour of the night
only one of the missing ones, namely, Tsering, had put in an
appearance.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was a matter of course
that we should have a day&rsquo;s rest in camp No. 47. When
day broke, I was awakened by the bleating of sheep. The
shepherd had at first followed the track of the horses, but
soon abandoned it when he noticed that the mules were not
there, and he began to look for the track of the latter.
In the darkness he got completely lost, and in a pass one
of the sheep had refused to go any farther. He had
carried it awhile, but as he soon felt that it had become
cold and stiff he threw it away as dead. Frightened of
the darkness and the wolves, he had taken refuge in a
gorge, tied together the sheep and goats in a circle, and set
himself in the middle to keep himself warm and look out
for the wolves. However, they had not ventured to attack
him. In the morning twilight he had found one of
the many tracks leading to camp No. 47.</p>

<p>Two of the missing men turned up in the forenoon,
carrying boxes. A horse had been left behind. Islam
Ahun, who had led the horse caravan, had cleverly conducted
them down by the shortest way to the lake, and
had encamped there beside good pasture. Muhamed Isa
and his companions had lost themselves in the night, and
had slept beside a fire, with nothing to eat or drink but
snow. But they, too, found their way to us again, and so
the remnants of the caravan were gathered together to one
place.</p>

<p>Here everything was sorted out that could be spared:
sacks, bags, ropes, horse-shoes, tools, and cooking utensils.
Boxes were burned after their contents had been transferred
to others; no one was allowed to burden the caravan
with unnecessary articles. The rejected goods formed a
large heap, and we thus got rid of two horse loads. Then
we took stock, and found that we had still 32 loads including
the boat. We had 20 mules, of which 2 were on
their last legs, and 21 horses also, including 2 ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
drop, or 37 serviceable animals in all. Only Robert and
I were allowed to ride, so that we had 3 spare horses; but
in the evening the loads were so distributed that all the
animals carried something, except the sickly ones. Four
animals were to be laden with maize and barley, the rice
made seven loads more, the meal five, the bread one, and
the butter, which the Ladakis took in their tea, only half a
load. We estimated that the meal would last a month
longer; five loads of rice were to be given up to the
animals, and I directed all the men to take the greatest care
of the veterans. Tundup Sonam shot three antelopes
just when our meat was finished. Some of the Ladakis
had to cut them up, and at even when they returned with
the spoil they intoned the antiphonal song they sing when
they carry a <i>dandy</i>, or an ordinary load, at home in Ladak.
One of the antelopes, however, was all devoured by the
wolves before they found it.</p>

<p>We decided to rest a couple of days at the next camp,
and Tundup Sonam undertook to conduct us to a small
lake lying to the east, where the grass was particularly
good.</p>

<p>In the night of October 24 a horse and two mules died,
so we had 38 animals. &ldquo;The strongest are still living,&rdquo;
said Muhamed Isa as usual.</p>

<p>To the north rose the lofty mountain system which had
caused us so much suffering, and its crests were seen
stretching to the east. We advanced over even ground,
and after a short march reached a small round lake firmly
frozen over, and surrounded by yellow grassland. Water
was supplied by a spring which filled a small frozen basin;
the animals drank as much as they would from a hole cut
through the ice; they had had no water for three days.
The sandy soil was frozen so hard that the iron tent-pegs
bent when they were driven into the ground. The sky
was overcast, and there was a strong wind, but the ground
to the east-south-east seemed favourable. The four tents
stood in a row, mine to windward, that I might not be
annoyed by the smoke of the other fires.</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock at night a flock of wild geese passed
over our camp in the brilliant, silvery-white moonshine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
They flew very low, and quacked the whole time. Probably
they intended to settle at the spring, but went on when
they found the place occupied. &ldquo;There is plenty of
light, and in a short time we shall be at the next spring.&rdquo;
Such, we may suppose, was the gist of the conversation between
the leading goose and the others. No doubt it
had given its orders at sunset, remarking: &ldquo;To-night we
will stay at the spring on the shore of the small lake, where
we rested last spring.&rdquo; All were agreed, and the flock,
flying in a wedge, had gradually dipped lower towards the
ground. But when they had passed over the hills which
concealed the spot from view, and saw the frozen lake
glancing like a mirror in the moonshine, the leading goose
called out, &ldquo;Men! we cannot stay so near to tents and
fires. Up again, and onwards.&rdquo; And all the flock
answered: &ldquo;We can rest at the next spring in the valley
behind the hills to the south.&rdquo; That was the conversation
I heard above my tent when all was quiet in the camp.
Perhaps the lively chatter was about something else, but I
think that I interpreted the wild geese correctly. For it
is quite certain that they hold consultations on their long
journeys, and discuss their plans. And why should they
not be endowed with intelligence? Why should they
speed away at random like soulless flying-machines? They
are just as dependent as ourselves on the earth and winds.
If they can cover 120 miles on a clear, calm day, they must
take a longer time over the same distance when storm and
contrary winds prevail. Therefore they cannot every year
pass the nights at the same springs, but must adapt their
arrangements to circumstances. But the wild geese know
every spring along the course they follow twice a year, and
when they are tired they settle at the first they come to. On
my travels in various parts of Tibet I have come to the conclusion
that the same parties or tribes of wild geese,
which have for generations bred at the same watercourses,
follow always the same routes through Tibet. The geese
which we saw on this occasion came, let us say, from
one of the lakes along the Tarim river below Shah-yar,
and intended to spend the winter in the neighbourhood of
Khatmandu, the capital of Nepal. In spring they return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
to the Tarim lakes, and follow exactly the same course
as in autumn, and so on from year to year. The young
ones, which are born on the Tarim, make the journey
over the mountains for the first time in autumn, but
they remember the way in the following autumn, and
afterwards the time comes when they in turn teach their
young ones the position of the sources. Thus the knowledge
of the route is never lost in the family, and the
leading geese would never dream of trying any other
course. We had already on several occasions seen wild
geese flying southwards, but they had certainly taken
other roads, come from other breeding-places, and had
other destinations. They belonged to other tribes. If it
were possible to draw on a map of Tibet all the tracks of
the various tribes of geese, they would form a whole
system of lines running more or less in a meridional
direction. Perhaps many of these lines would in parts
merge into one another like the fine ripples on the surface
of a sand-dune. Perhaps now and then a line runs in
sharp zigzags. It may then be taken for granted that it
was thus drawn in the most remote antiquity when the
patriarchs of each tribe first sought out the way from one
spring to another. Each tribe is divided into a number of
communities, and each of these into families. Probably all
the geese of one community are closely related to one
another. Each community remains together on the
journey, but how do they choose a leader? It may be
supposed that the oldest goose flies at the head of the
flock, for it must be the most experienced, and if it dies the
next oldest is its natural successor. I am fond of the
wild geese, and admire their intelligence and their wonderful
bump of locality; we shall hereafter come into closer
contact with them.</p>

<p>In camp 48 we remained fully three days inactive, and
the south wind howled continuously: &ldquo;Patience! Patience!&rdquo;
To us the days seemed very long, but the animals must
have rest. On the first morning horse No. 39 lay dead on
the ground, and was entered with the same number in the
list of the dead.</p>

<p>The wolves were impudent, and howled just outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
our camp, but they were more polite after Tundup had
shot a brute, which ran off on to the ice, and lay down to
die in the middle of the lake. The scoundrel soon had as
companion a raven, which had taken into his head to peck
the manes of the living horses and disturb them while
grazing. At nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening the thermometer
indicated &minus;6°, and in the night &minus;18½°.</p>

<p>In the morning Muhamed Isa reported that the dung-gatherers
had discovered something which they described
as ruins of stone houses. Robert and I went at once to
look at them. We found that there actually were three
quadrangular walls constructed of slabs of schist, probably
of very ancient date. They rose but just above
the ground, and on digging we discovered that they
went down fully 3 feet. Probably they had been constructed
only as foundations and wind screens for permanent
tents, for such walls were afterwards met with
on several occasions. There was no trace of a hearth.
The Ladakis, who had travelled much in west Tibet,
thought that the place had once been the permanent abode
of some Changpas who had wished to avoid paying taxes
to the Devashung, or the Government in Lhasa.</p>

<p>At any rate this discovery had a very encouraging
effect on us. We had not seen men for 65 days, and
now we found the first sign indicating their proximity.
We felt invigorated, and the tale-teller in Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s
tent in the evening was longer winded than ever. He sang
a song, all joining in the chorus. Now we must keep a
sharp look-out in the country before us, for this first sign of
man must surely be succeeded by others.</p>

<p>The caravan moved on towards the east-south-east on
October 28 in a very violent south-west storm. A mule
had died in the night, and so we had 36 baggage animals,
but since the last inspection the provisions had diminished
by nearly three loads. In this camp, also, superfluous
articles were left behind. I threw away <i>Sonja</i>, by Blicher-Clausen.
Robert and I sat at the morning fire, while
the men saddled the horses, and I amused myself by
tearing out one leaf of the book after another and throwing
the whole collection into the air, where the wind swept the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
flying leaves with tremendous velocity to the north-east.
The ten ravens puzzled their heads as to what new species
of flying creatures they could be, but made little effort to
get out of their way, and the dogs soon gave up the
attempt to pursue the leaves; but one of Tsering&rsquo;s pack-horses
was so alarmed that it shied, broke loose, and
rushed up the hills, and was not caught again for a good
half hour. Meanwhile Sonja swept on, fluttering over
mountain and valley, much to my satisfaction, for I had
felt annoyed the evening before because she left her good-hearted
husband. When and where would these leaves
come to rest after flying over endless stretches of unknown
country? Certainly a book has seldom had so wide a
distribution.</p>

<p>We follow the track of the caravan in an open, flat
valley between low mountains. After riding some hours
we were so perished that we had to make a halt in a
hollow way and light a fire. My small white Ladak
horse was in excellent condition; he treated the cold and
other disagreeable incidents with philosophical calmness.
The tall dapple-grey which I had ridden from Leh was
usually off duty, for he showed symptoms of exhaustion.
At this day&rsquo;s camp there was no water, only snow in a
cleft of the mountain. Yet we were in very high spirits,
for the men had seen fireplaces built of three stones laid
crossways, which were intended to hold a kettle. It must
have been a long time, however, since they were used, for
neither ash nor soot was seen among them. An iron ladle,
too, was found, such as the Tibetans use to melt lead for
bullets. So either robbers or hunters must have halted
here sometime or other.</p>

<p class="center chap2">IN THE LAND OF THE WILD YAK</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">We</span> broke up our camp on the morning of October 29,
after a night of 49 degrees of frost, at an early hour, so as
to find water for our thirsty animals as soon as possible.
A small lake and two springs we passed were frozen as
hard as rock; beside one lay the skull of a yak, which had
evidently had its throat cut with a knife; we also saw two
fireplaces on the way, and at camp No. 50 a path, which,
however, might have been worn by wild yaks. We therefore
were no doubt coming near to other men, and we were
always on the look-out for tents.</p>

<p>Next day the storm increased in strength, and it was
only with the greatest effort of will that I could use my
hands for map-sketching. We seemed paralyzed and could
no longer think clearly. We were like the field-mice, which
run from one hole to another seeking to find shelter from
the wind and cold.</p>

<p>On arriving at a spring I slipped down wearily from my
horse, and thought I should be frozen before the fire was
kindled. Muhamed Isa, also, and four other men, were ill,
and could not assist in setting up the tents. When my
tent was ready, I crept into bed in my clothes, boots and all.
While Robert and Tsering were covering me up with warm
wraps I was seized with violent ague, my teeth chattered,
and my head ached terribly. Robert, who had been
trained in nursing in Dr. Arthur Neve&rsquo;s school, now
proved an excellent doctor, and took every care of me.
As soon as we were under cover he plunged into the
study of Burroughs and Wellcome&rsquo;s medical instructions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
The Tabloid Brand Medicine Chest stood open, as frequently
happened, in my tent. Stanley, Emin Pasha,
Jackson, Scott, and many other travellers have prized this
ideal travelling dispensary as highly as myself. My
case, a present from the English firm, had been filled with
especial regard to the climate of Tibet.</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock at night Robert and Tsering undressed
me. There were 47.9 degrees of frost in the night, and
the storm howled dreadfully. Robert took my temperature
every two hours, and it rose to 106½°, high-fever mark. As
he told me after, he pondered whatever he was to do
if I remained for good at camp No. 51. I could not sleep,
and Robert and Tsering watched beside my bed in turn;
glowing lumps of fuel were brought in all through the
night, and a burning candle was placed behind a box,
where it was protected from wind and draught. I was
constantly delirious and the men were much concerned,
for they had never seen me ill before.</p>

<p>Next day the fever had slightly abated, when Muhamed
Isa slipped gently into my tent to inquire how the Sahib
was. He informed us that the wounded yak was dead, and
that, in cutting it up, two Tibetan bullets had been found;
also at three places hearths had been seen, which could not
be more than two months old, for ashes still lay among the
stones. So hunters had been here in autumn, and he
was quite convinced that we should soon meet with the
first nomads.</p>

<p>It was still as the grave, only the storm howled and
moaned. All the men in the camp were afraid of disturbing
me, but I gave orders in the evening that they
should sing as usual. I could not lift an arm without
help, and I lay hour after hour watching the curious lights
in the tent. Within, the stearin candle emitted a dull
light, and the yellowish-red blaze of the fire and the bluish
moonlight penetrated from without. The singing sounded
melancholy and wistful, and was accompanied by the
howling of the storm.</p>

<p>On November 2 the storm still raged, having now
continued to the sixth day. I had slept a few hours,
though the cold sank to 52° below freezing-point. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
getting a little better, but I was still extremely weak.
Robert, who was troubled because his horse had died in
the night, read to me one of the novels we had stolen from
Deasy&rsquo;s depôt. Tsering and Rehim Ali massaged me in
the Asiatic manner to restore my strength. And so we
arrived at the fourth evening. I had been confined to my
bed for four-and-eighty hours, the soil of Tibet seemed determined
to keep me, and perhaps I should be allowed only to
dream of the forbidden land at a distance.</p>

<p>Surely on November 3 the god of the winds must have
said to the westerly storm, &ldquo;Six days shalt thou labour&mdash;on
the seventh thou shalt become a hurricane.&rdquo; Dust and
sand penetrated the thin canvas and covered everything in
the tent. The men, who had led the animals to water, had
rings of dust round their eyes, and their faces were ashy
grey. For my part I felt like one of our poor worn-out
brutes, which does not know whether he will reach the
next camp. Then I decided to remain here with some of
the men and some provisions, while Robert and Muhamed
Isa went in search of natives, whom they might send to
fetch me. But no; I would try to hold myself in the
saddle, for I did not wish to remain in this miserable
fever-camp. I wore a whole wardrobe of winter clothes:
several trousers, my leather jersey, the ulster, fur coat, cap,
and <i>bashlik</i>; it was a heavy weight for my weak, tottering
legs as I walked to my horse and was lifted into the saddle.</p>

<p>We followed the shore of the small lake near our camp.
But I soon perceived, after nearly falling again and again,
that the exertion was too much for me, so we halted and
lighted a fire. After a short rest we rode on, and were
delighted when at length we saw the smoke of our caravan
rising behind a hill, where it had camped by a source and
had found fireplaces erected last summer, with skulls and
horns of tame sheep around them. Yak dung was very
plentiful; the source was, therefore, a watering-place of
wild yaks. A third of the men were really ill, most of
them suffered from headache, and all were more or less
indisposed. Robert alone was in good health, and he
nursed us.</p>

<p>On November 5 the tracks of men became more frequent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
A yak&rsquo;s skeleton lay beside a hearth, and the ashes
piled up among the stones could not have been cold longer
than the day before. We climbed up troublesome hills and
then descended into a gully leading down to a large valley
begirt with fiery red heights. A number of excavations,
each with a heap of sand beside it, attracted our attention.
The sand contained gold, so not ordinary nomads but
gold-seekers had been here, probably every summer, to
dig for gold.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the valley warm springs burst forth
with a temperature of 57°, so that the water seems quite
hot. A few yards farther, however, it forms a large sheet
of ice.</p>

<p>In the next valley, a hollow between precipitous
terraced slopes, a huge wild yak lay dead on the ground
with twelve of our men standing round it. Tundup
Sonam had surprised a whole herd which had come
down into the valley to drink. The other animals had
torn up the valley in headlong flight, but this one, struck
by a bullet, had made for the hunter, and Tundup clambered
up the edge of a terrace only just in time. The yak
remained at the foot, uncertain what to do, and received
a second shot in the heart.</p>

<p>I photographed him from several points of view before
he was skinned. It was not easy to raise him into a suitable
posture; the twelve men had to put forth all their strength.
The raven-black coat of the beast formed a strong contrast
to the red soil; his long side fringes serve him as a mattress
when he lies down (Illustrations 68, 69).</p>

<p>On November 7 we skirted a lake; to the right we had
steep mountains with disagreeable cones of sharp-edged
débris. Two troops of fine Ammon sheep, numbering
nine and five respectively, skipped with bold leaps over the
smooth abrupt rocks. Large numbers of hares were
seen, and frequently the holes of marmots where the
inmates were still hibernating. Two Tibetan cairns proved
to us that we were on the right way, that is, the one
the gold-diggers use.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">84. <span class="sc">Rehim Ali falls to the Ground and thus rescues us from the Furious Yak</span>.</td></tr></table>

<p>Now we leave this part of the mountains on the right,
and proceed along the southern, open and extensive plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
by the lake shore. There grazed a herd of perhaps fifty
yaks. Twenty antelopes, probably frightened by the
caravan, scampered away with elastic springs like the
shadow of clouds moving over the earth. Soon the tents
and all the details of camp No. 56 could be clearly
distinguished, and we had only a few minutes&rsquo; march more,
when even this short distance would have been too far for
one of us, if fate had so willed.</p>

<p>For close beside the tents, near our animals, a large black
yak appeared. Rehim Ali drew our attention to it, but we
took no farther notice of it. I took my last bearing of the
tent, and was in the act of laying down the ground on my
map-sheet, when a shot cracked from Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tent,
and the yak, evidently hit, rushed madly northwards. We
followed him with our eyes, expecting to see him fall.
But no; he turned and came running wildly towards us.
Rehim Ali&rsquo;s face was contorted with frantic fright, and he
raised his hands to heaven, crying out, &ldquo;Allah, Allah, we
are lost!&rdquo; The brute drew near in a cloud of dust, his
fringes waved and flew about, and he lowered his horns for
a rush. I did not move, for I thought that he had not seen
us and would turn back again, but he held on his way and
grew larger to the sight. Rehim Ali ran screaming to the
tents, but suddenly turned round, and as our horses took
fright and galloped off, he caught hold of the tail of
Robert&rsquo;s steed, hoping to follow us at a run. The wild
chase swept quicker and quicker over the plain, and the yak
changed his course and made a circuit towards us in
a mad rage. His breath rose like clouds of steam from
his nostrils, his muzzle almost grazed the ground&mdash;he was
ready to catch his victim on his horns, toss him into the
air, and stamp him to a jelly under his forefeet. Nearer
and nearer I heard him, panting and gasping like a steam
saw. Turning in my saddle I saw him about twenty yards
off, his small, fierce eyes blazing with fury and madness
and rolling so as to show the blood-stained whites. It
was a question of a second. I rode straight to the right;
my horse and I would be the first to be caught on the
horns of the yak. Now the horses stretched their legs
like bow-strings. I tore off my red <i>bashlik</i> and waved it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
behind me to attract the yak and stop him, but he did not
look at it. Then I tore my belt off in order to take off my
fur coat and throw it over the yak&rsquo;s eyes and blind him, just
when he was on the point of thrusting his horns into
the belly of the horse and stiffening the muscles of his
neck for the toss. A second more and the yak would hoist
the horse, break my back, and trample on my chest&mdash;I
seemed to hear the cracking and breaking of my ribs,
and I well deserved it, for it was my fault alone that all
the animals left behind us had to suffer so much. Then
was heard a heart-rending cry of despair. As I turned
quickly round, I saw Rehim Ali with uplifted arms fall
senseless to the ground, and the yak turn and rush at him.
He remained prostrate, a lifeless mass, and I saw the yak,
with lowered horns, and his purple tongue hanging far out of
his mouth, dash down upon him in a cloud of dust. Now
all the horses made off, and I had some difficulty to keep
my seat on my grey Ladaki. When I looked round again,
a second later, the yak was running up the valley with his
dust cloud about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn back and see if there is still a spark of life in
Rehim Ali, and if he can still be saved,&rdquo; I called out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, it is too dangerous, the yak is still near, and
may come back. Muhamed Isa and all the rest are running
out of the camp to look after Rehim Ali.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I had already turned, and I rode to the fallen man.
He lay dead on his face with arms outstretched&mdash;both
Robert and I thought, at any rate, that he was dead. But
when we had dismounted beside him he slowly turned his
head, and with a look of horror waved his hand, as much
as to say: &ldquo;Do not trouble about me, I am dead as a
mouse.&rdquo; We could not repress a smile when, turning him
over like a joint at the fire, we examined his bones and
joints, and found that the fellow was still sound, though
severely bruised. The yak had trodden upon the inner
side of the left shank, where a bloody stripe showed the mark
of his hoof.</p>

<p>Two strong men bore the fallen hero to Muhamed
Isa&rsquo;s tent, where he was well tended by Robert. He seemed
stupefied for several days, and we feared that his adventure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
had affected his brain. He did not eat or speak, and had
to travel on horseback, and one of his fellow-countrymen
was told off to attend on him. After some time, when his
head was clear again, he was able to tell us his impressions.
When he saw the yak preparing to attack my horse, he
turned round and threw himself flat on the ground. Perhaps
irritated by the red and violet <i>chapkan</i> floating about in the
air, the yak left me, made an unexpected change of front, and
rushed with lowered horns on the fallen man. He had half
unconsciously made a quick movement to one side, and the
horns had struck the ground instead of entering his body,
and so close beside his head that Rehim Ali felt the panting
breath of the brute in his face. Then he lost consciousness,
and did not revive till we came up, and then he
thought that the yak was on him again. He had intended
to save himself by this man&oelig;uvre, and thereby had become
our deliverer. After the adventures he had taken part in
lately he had an immense horror of Tibetan lakes and
wild yaks (Illustrations 83, 84).</p>

<p>Temperature&mdash;16½° on the night of November 28.
One would expect that the temperature would fall with the
advance of winter, but it remains constant, owing in great
measure to our progress southwards. Beyond a small pass
we came to a new longitudinal valley, where the country
was open towards the south-east. Game was abundant,
spoors crossed one another in all directions, and two bold
yaks awakened in us greater respect than before. At six
places we saw large herds of wild asses, and antelopes
grazed on the plains. We lost a mule here, and had now
16 animals of both kinds.</p>

<p>Another day&rsquo;s journey across flat country. We were
traversing the large white patch of unknown land, and
were approaching Bower&rsquo;s route at an acute angle, though
we were still rather far east of it. A wild yak ran across our
path, and we wondered if it were our enemy of the previous
day. Where we pitched our camp, No. 58, we found some
hearths which could not be more than a couple of days old.
Our excitement and eagerness increased day by day; now
the uttermost margin of inhabited Tibet could not be far
distant. As I let my eyes rove over these red or black,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
snow-capped or bare crests, I could fancy I could perceive
a whole host of dancing notes of interrogation, some in
fantastic draperies, mocking us because we had ventured
without an escort into the forbidden land, others motioning
us onwards, but all doubtful and speculative. Step by
step, day by day, with failing strength, we approached the
solution of all these questions. Any moment a troop of
mounted men might appear on the horizon, bringing orders
from the Devashung that we must immediately evacuate
the country and retire northwards.</p>

<p>I was still convalescent, went to bed at seven o&rsquo;clock,
and was not much the better for it, for I always felt
terribly languid. Tsering was very despondent because
I did so little honour to his cooking. &ldquo;How can the
Sahib regain his strength if he eats so little?&rdquo; he used to
remind me. He was a comical fellow, Tsering, as he
marched day after day with his stick in his hand at the
head of his detachment, self-conscious and pompous as a
chanticleer.</p>

<p>Late at night we heard the dismal, long-drawn howling
of wolves close at hand. We could tell from the wild
complaining tone that hunger had made the brutes bolder
and that the odour of fresh meat excited them. They
were on the other side of the source, and Tundup Sonam
stole off to scare them away by firing into the troop, though
there was small chance of hitting one in the darkness.
The brutes retired, but in the night chased our animals,
which scampered off to the north as though there were a
fire behind them. But the men followed their trail, and
found them at dawn a good day&rsquo;s journey from the camp.</p>

<p>On November 10 we had good ground again, and saw
to the east-south-east a lake which looked like a bright white
ring, the middle being deep blue. Near this day&rsquo;s camp,
No. 59, were clear traces of a man who had driven five
tame yaks to the lake. The footprints were at most three
days old, and excited a great stir in the caravan. We were
undoubtedly close to human dwellings, and I thought with
regret of the interval of nearly three months during which
we had no cause to dread hostile tribes. We held a council
of war: should we as long as possible avoid contact with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
men, and keep out of the way of their tents, so that we
need not turn back until further progress became quite
impossible? Or should we seek out the nearest nomads
at once, and beg them for assistance? At this moment
Tundup Sonam ran up out of breath. He had been
scouting to the west and had descried a black tent. I
immediately sent him to it with two other men, and gave
them a handful of rupees. But the news they brought
from this first meeting with human beings was not particularly
interesting.</p>

<p>The tent was inhabited by a woman and her three
children. She had come from the district of Gertse in the
south-west, and had covered the distance in twenty-five
short days&rsquo; marches. She had arrived seventeen days before
with her two husbands, but both had returned a few days
ago to Gertse, after they had filled the tent for her with
wild-ass meat. She was daily expecting her parents, who
were to keep her company for three months, during which
time they would live on game&mdash;yaks, kiangs, and antelopes.
She owned a few yaks and a small flock of sheep, which
she and the oldest child tended and milked. The inside of
the tent was very wretched, but a warm fire burned in the
centre. She knew that four more tents were standing in a
neighbouring valley. When Tundup Sonam told her that
we were a party of Ladakis on a pilgrimage to the holy
places, she replied that we had chosen a very bad route,
and would have done better to take a more southern road
where there were men. Her geographical knowledge was
limited. The country in which we were now she called
Gomo-selung. The gold placers we had passed lay in the
La-shung country, and the lake at camp No. 55 she called
La-shung-tso. My servants, who had already been in
Tibet, held that this information was reliable, for they had
heard the names before.</p>

<p>Now, then, the ice was broken. After seventy-nine
days of complete isolation from the outer world, some of
our men, at least, had seen human beings. But other connections
would soon follow this lonely woman, this daughter
of the wilderness, this real lady of the mountains, and again
we discussed the line of policy we must adopt. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
woman dwelt alone, and no news of our approach could be
conveyed through her instrumentality to the south. We
could, then, take the matter for the present quite coolly as
heretofore, and when we were surrounded on all sides by
nomads, among whom reports are rapidly dispersed, we
must then think of hastening our movements.</p>

<p>We granted the animals a day&rsquo;s rest, for the pasturage
was good, and it was pleasant to spend this day under
canvas. The storm whistled and howled through the
grass and round the stones. Everything that was light
and loose was blown away, and the ground was swept
clean. The sky was cloudless and the air clear, the wild
commotion was only in the layer of air close to the ground,
and the important part played by the wind in the deformation
of the surface was evident; in such a storm huge
masses of material must be removed from their original
position.</p>

<p>In the night the storm ceased all of a sudden, and it
became so still all at once that I awoke. It was as though
we had encamped by a waterfall which in an instant ceased
to roar. One starts up and wonders what has happened,
but one soon becomes accustomed to the stillness, and finds
the absence of the noise and the draught a relief.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE FIRST NOMADS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Sad</span> news again on the morning of November 12: two of
our best horses were dead, and a third, which had carried
two boxes, made in Stockholm, all the way from Leh, was
at the point of death. All three had been sound on the
preceding evening, and they died with exactly the same
symptoms. They became giddy, lost control of their legs,
fell down, and were unable to get up again. I hoped to
rescue the remnants of my caravan, and was already thinking
of the time when I could lead the poor beasts to mangers
in Shigatse full of sweet-smelling clover, and now those that
we had reckoned the strongest had broken down. Now
only 13 horses were left, and the loads would soon be too
heavy for the survivors.</p>

<p>But it had not come to that yet, for this day, which
commenced so sadly, brought us joy before the sun went
down. Following the track of the caravan we rode among
hills, and saw below us camp No. 60 in a deep valley. I
had just entered my tent when Muhamed Isa announced
that Tundup Sonam was coming from the upper valley in
the company of two Tibetans, one mounted, the other on
foot. Timorous, and doubtful whether Tundup Sonam
had allured them to a robber band, the Tibetans laid their
long clumsy guns on the ground and came forward
cautiously. Tundup had needed all the fascinations of
his eloquence to induce them to come with him. He had
told them that we were pilgrims accompanying an eminent
lama from Ladak to the holy places: Then they had
answered that they would come and show their reverence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
for His Holiness, and bring with them a sheep&rsquo;s stomach
full of butter, and another with goat&rsquo;s milk, as a testimony
of their deep respect. Muhamed Isa, who was accustomed
to deal with Tibetans, allayed their fears, taking them into his
tent and talking and joking with them. Then they were
brought to me, and they laid their presents on the ground,
fell on their knees, put out their tongues, and made a low
obeisance. Instead of a holy man they found a European,
but seemed by no means displeased with the change.
Muhamed Isa acted as interpreter. They must first give
us information on the geography of the country and the
character of the land through which our route lay. The
information received from the lady of the mountains was
confirmed in every respect, and they told us that we should
meet with no men for several days, but after that should
pass black tents daily.</p>

<p>Our guests might be fifty and forty years old respectively.
The elder was quite a typical specimen, more like an ape
than a man; the younger looked as though he had already
met with many adventures, and he would have passed very
well for a robber chief (Illustrations 85, 86).</p>

<p>The conversation now commenced may have little
intrinsic interest, but to us in our condition it was as
exciting as a tale&mdash;our salvation was involved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long is it by the nearest way to Shigatse?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four long, or five short, days&rsquo; march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you guide us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we are paid to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the Bombo Chimbo (great chief) shall decide
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any horses you can sell us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have two, but we will not sell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any yaks for sale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will sell five, if we get 20 rupees for each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give us some of your sheep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have six, if you will pay 4 rupees a head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Bring all the animals you are ready to sell,
and if we are satisfied with them you shall be well
paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bombo Chimbo must remain here till to-morrow
if we are to do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then agreed that we should remain. But I
knew the Tibetans, and was aware that they promise much
and perform little. We therefore kept the fellows with us
for the night, and they slept in Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tent. In
the evening they were enraptured by the tones of our
flutes, and felt so much at home that their tongues were
loosened, and rattled like praying-mills. I heard their
cackling until I went to sleep.</p>

<p>And this night I slept well. After eighty days of complete
solitude we again had men as guests in our tents;
we had obtained fine, rich goat&rsquo;s milk, and next day we
should feast on well-fed mutton; we had received information
about the country and the marches before us on the
way to our far-off destination. And what was best of all,
our veterans, our caravan animals, would get help. And
this help was a boon from heaven; for this day, after we
had lost three more horses at once, and when Rehim
Ali must unfortunately be reckoned among the baggage,
the loads had become too heavy for the animals. The
future seemed more promising. Certainly the ridge of the
Samoma-sakcho mountains did not exhibit a more purple
colour in the evening light than the mountains which we
had seen glowing in a grand display of colours on many a
lonesome night; the blue smoke of the camp-fires danced
a fairy dance on the steppe grass just as before, and the
night came down just as dark and cold over the mountains
to the east, but all around us to-day inspired us with
cheerfulness and hope.</p>

<p>The new day had hardly broken when our two
Changpas set out homewards with some of the Ladakis,
to make preparations for the great business transaction.
Two hours later we were the fortunate owners of five fine
yaks, which, the Tibetans affirmed, could easily carry four
boxes each, whereas our horses and mules had carried only
two. One of the yaks was to take over the boat, and the
horse which had carried it from Lake Lighten was relieved
of the work. I breathed freely again when I saw the faithful
animal without anything to carry. Then we bought four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
sheep at 4 rupees each, and exchanged our last three
sheep for two fresh ones, paying 2 rupees in addition.
At the Gomo lake our last eight goats obtained their well-earned
rest, being exchanged for as many Tibetan and a
money payment of 1 rupee a head. In the evening I
had three times as much milk as usual, and richer and
better than our exhausted goats had supplied. Both parties
were thoroughly satisfied with the bargain (Illustration 88).</p>

<p>Good old Changpas! The wandering cavaliers of the
wilderness came to us, looking picturesquely savage with
their black coarse hair hanging down over their shoulders
and back, and making their furs greasy, with long, dark
matchlocks on their shoulders, clumsy sabres and knives in
their belts, and mounted on small, tough, long-haired
horses. Though wild and dirty, they were yet kindly,
friendly and good-tempered, and were certainly not cold in
their old dingy fur coats. The elder wore a small round
fur cap, the younger a <i>bashlik</i> of fur, which covered his
whole head except the face. They had their provisions
and all kinds of other articles they wanted on their journey
stuffed into their fur coats in front, and from the belts
which held their fur coats together, hung knives, awl,
flint and steel, pipe and tobacco pouch, which swung and
knocked together at every step. They wore felt boots,
originally white, but now black and worn-out, but had no
trousers&mdash;it must be far too cool to sit trouserless in the
saddle with 36 degrees of frost.</p>

<p>As they came from Gertse, the country to the south-west,
they had hardly any knowledge of the region through
which we were to travel, but they thought that we should
require at least fifty days for the journey to Shigatse.
They pass the winter in the Gomo district, living on the
game there. They could easily serve a little breakfast
with which the most exacting gourmand might be satisfied.
Is not the following menu tempting?</p>

<div class="list condensed">
<p>A bowl of goat&rsquo;s milk with rich yellow cream.</p>

<p>Yak kidneys, fried a golden yellow in fat.</p>

<p>Marrow from yak bones, toasted over the fire.</p>

<p>Small, delicate pieces of tender, juicy meat from the vertebræ of the antelope, laid before the fire and slowly browned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span></p>

<p>Antelope head, held in the flames with the hide and hair on till it is blackened with soot.</p>
</div>

<p>Their taste is in general very different from ours.
When they have killed a wild ass, they cut it up and keep
the pieces in the tent, piled up around it as far as possible
from the fire. The longer it has lain there, the better it is
supposed to taste. The Changpas prefer to eat their meat
raw, hard, dry, and old. They take out from the recesses
of their fur coats a yak&rsquo;s rib, which looks more like a piece
of blackened wood than anything edible. Then the knife
is brought out, and the hard meat is removed in strips or
lumps from the bone. Chinese brick-tea is their greatest
luxury, and the thicker and dirtier it is, the better they like
it. They stir it up with a piece of butter.</p>

<p>Like the wild geese, they have learned by traditional
experience where the best camping-grounds are. One
may be sure that their tent is always pitched at places
where there is little or no wind; that there is good
pasture at hand for their tame yaks, sheep, goats, and
horses, if they have any; that good hunting-grounds are
to be found not far from the tent, and that water is always
to be had. At the Gomo lake they have excellent table-salt
cost free. When their domestic animals have eaten up
the grass around, and the game has been frightened away,
they transfer their camp to another district. The tents are
set up at the same spots where their forefathers have
pitched them for innumerable generations, and where
frequently old votive cairns have been erected of loose
stones to propitiate the spirits that rule over mountain and
dale.</p>

<p>To the Changpas, or &ldquo;inhabitants of the north,&rdquo; who
spend the winter in the north, the chase is the chief resource,
and cattle-breeding is of secondary importance.
The Tibetans in Gertse and Senkor, on the Bogtsang-tsangpo,
or in Naktsang, who own large herds, do not
move northwards in winter, for with them hunting is an
occasional occupation. The hunting tribes pursue the yak,
the kiang, and the antelope. In hilly country they stalk
them against the wind. Constant life in the open air has
wonderfully sharpened their intelligence. They know the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
peculiarities and habits of the yak as well as he does himself,
and know how far they may go without overstepping the
limits of his acuteness. They know that his senses of sight
and hearing are not particularly well developed, but that
he soon scents the huntsman, so that the attack must be
made from the lee side. Though he goes on the chase in
his thick fur coat, the huntsman creeps as noiselessly and as
lithe as a panther till he approaches within range of his
prey. Then he lays his gun on the rest, strikes fire from
the flint with his steel, catches it in tinder, sets light to the
end of the match, and sees that the hammer brings the fire
at the right moment into the touch-hole. All is done so
quietly, so deliberately and carefully, that the hunter has
every prospect of bringing down the game.</p>

<p>Another time he watches for hours together behind a
wall which he or his forefathers, perhaps his great-great-grandfather,
has built beside a spring, and waits with
angelic patience for a troop of wild asses, which come at
sunset to quench their thirst. But the antelopes, wild
sheep, and gazelles are too wide-awake to be caught by
the most skilful hunter. Yet the antelopes do not always
succeed in escaping his cunning toils. He lays nooses for
them on the old established antelope paths; among the
hunting nomads in the interior of Tibet, the quantities of
antelope meat garnishing the sides of the tents are
astonishing.</p>

<p>While the men are away, the women look after the
yaks and sheep, and when the hunter returns at sunset
he sees the former chewing the cud in front of the tent,
while the latter are shut up in a pen-fold of stone. The
yaks remain at night near the tents, and hence the dung,
the only fuel of the nomads, has not to be carried far.
When it is dark, all gather round the fire on which the
tea-kettle boils. Then they talk of the monotonous incidents
of their life, of the day&rsquo;s bag, the condition of their
herds, and the work of next day. One mends his soles
with sinew and an awl, another dresses a yak hide with his
hands, and a third cuts straps from the skin of a wild ass.
Their life seems void and uneventful, but they have no
wants&mdash;they know nothing better. They have a severe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
struggle for life in this unproductive corner of the world,
which is called the Chang-tang, or the north plain, where
it has been their fate to be born. Amidst poverty and
danger they live victorious in God&rsquo;s free Nature; the awful
storms are their brothers, the lordship of the valleys they
share with the wild beasts of the desert, and at night the
everlasting stars twinkle over their black tents. If they
were given comfortable huts down south in the shade of
walnut trees, they would always be longing for the grand
solitude of the mountains, for the icy cold, the drifting
snow, and the moonlight of the peaceful winter nights in
Tibet.</p>

<p>Then Death comes one day and looks in through the
tent door; in vain is the constant prayer &ldquo;Om mani padme
hum&rdquo; repeated; vain are all attempts to conjure or propitiate
the evil powers that are inimical to the children of
men. Bent, wrinkled, and grey the old hunter finishes his
course, and is borne on strong shoulders to some shallow
cleft near the mountain crest, and there abandoned to the
wolves and birds of prey. When his grandchildren are
grown up, they do not know whither he has been taken;
in life he had no abiding dwelling-place, and after death he
has no grave. And no one asks where the bones of the
dead are bleaching, for the place is haunted by evil spirits.</p>

<p>November 14. Calm! In the night there were again
49 degrees of frost, but it was fairly warm riding southwards
towards the sun. The two horses of the Tibetans
had stampeded. But if this were a trick contrived to give
them an excuse for making off themselves, it did not succeed
this time; for I sent off one of them with two of my
men to look for the horses, while the other had to accompany
me and tell me the names of the places we passed.
We did not know our men yet, and therefore did not
dare to let them out of our sight, or they might have
despatched mounted messengers to give information to
the authorities in Gertse. Then we should have been
ordered to halt sooner than it suited us. Now we could
feel easy, at least till we came to the next tent. But the
horses were recovered, and the old man stumped after us
leading them by the bridle. Then we rode together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
between the hills and over small passes. Here, too, gold
occurred in two places. Men come every summer, dig up
the sand, throw it into the air, and collect the grains of
gold on a cloth spread out on the ground. If the output
is abundant, the number of gold-diggers is doubled the
following summer.</p>

<p>In camp No. 61, also, the Tibetans showed no desire
to desert us; they were friendly and attentive, helped us in
unloading and setting up the tents, collected fuel, and
undertook to be answerable for the horses. They seemed
not to have the slightest suspicion that the country was
forbidden to us, and not an echo of any especial orders had
reached them from the south. I could not learn how
matters stood. The plan of my journey had been alluded
to in the Indian press, and there was nothing to prevent
tidings being carried to Lhasa through Darjiling or Pekin;
and I knew also from experience how soon an order against
a European is handed on among the nomads. I had
counted on hurrying on, like a thief in the night, as soon as
possible after the English mission to Lhasa, and appearing
on the scene before the Tibetans had quite made up their
mind about the political state of affairs. But perhaps I
was wrong, perhaps stricter regulations than ever had been
passed.</p>

<p>The western shadows move over the plain; only in the
east are the hills deep crimson, in the west they show a pitch-black
outline. Another night spreads out its dark-blue
pinions, and rises up to the zenith, driving before it an expiring
reflexion of the setting sun. When the stars begin to shine
we are out of doors examining the animals, which rejoice at
being more lightly loaded on the march. At seven o&rsquo;clock
I am massaged and go to bed. At nine o&rsquo;clock Robert
comes with the hypsometer, and we talk for an hour. Then
the light is allowed to burn till it flickers out. I lie a long
time awake, watching the shadows come and go, as the
wind shakes the canvas. I gaze at them till they turn into
monsters and wild yaks, dancing mockingly round my
prison. Now it is striking midnight in the towns of
Siberia and India which lie on our meridian, and at length
comes the deliverer sleep and drives away the shadow-pictures:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
they melt away and vanish on the horizon, which
recedes more and more into the distance, no longer bounded
by the thin web of the tent. Now a low murmur seems to
call to mind forests, meadows, and small rocky islands. I
dream that a strong hand leads me to a parting in the ways.
It points to a road, and a voice tells me that this will lead me
to a land of peace, hospitality, and summer, while the other
leads to dangers and privations among dark lofty mountains.
When Tsering brought the brazier in the morning, I was
glad that I had in my dream chosen the latter road without
hesitation.</p>

<p>We penetrated further and further into this mysterious
Tibet. During the next day&rsquo;s march we passed a succession
of deserted fireplaces, and in some places saw rows of
stone cairns to entice the antelopes into snares. Then we
ascended a valley, in which a small strip of ice gradually
expanded into a cake, filling all the space between the firm
slabs of greenstone. The Seoyinna came in sight&mdash;a dark
mountain to the south, which would remain visible for a
couple of days longer.</p>

<p>Our Tibetans are already as intimate with us all as
though we had been friends from childhood, and say that
they have never met with such decent people. The elder
is called Puntsuk, the younger Tsering Dava. We sit for
hours together at Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s fire and talk pleasantly,
and I take notes as they describe to me in detail all the
routes in Tibet they are acquainted with. Tsering Dava
has accomplished the pilgrimage to Tso-rinpoche, or the
holy lake Manasarowar, which I long to reach, and which
has been the subject of my dreams for many a day. The
two men were to accompany us only three days more; they
had left their yaks and sheep to the care of their wives and
children, and wolves were extraordinarily numerous; otherwise
they would have travelled any distance with us. They
had arrived from Gertse nineteen days before, and intended
to stay six months; forty or fifty parties come every year
from Gertse to this country.</p>

<p>They told us that the Tokpas, or gold-diggers, when
they go up to the goldfields for two or three months, take
as provisions meal and meat, which are carried by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
sheep and yaks. When the provisions are consumed they
return home, passing the salt lakes, where they load their
animals with salt, which they barter in inhabited districts
for barley. Thus they make a twofold profit on their
journey, and can live the rest of the year on their gains.</p>

<p>In the evening a dead horse, emaciated and wretched,
lay on the ice in our valley. I had procured him for 70
rupees from a dealer in Leh, who in December 1901 had
bought my last nine camels. Next morning a mule died
just as unexpectedly. He looked brisk and sound, and
allowed himself to be loaded as usual, but had not gone a
hundred paces when he fell dead. The two small Tibetan
horses, which travel with us, take a great interest in their
fellows; but they do not seem quite sure that the animals,
so thin and wretched, are really horses. At this day&rsquo;s
camp, No. 63, we saw them run up to their masters for two
large pieces of frozen antelope flesh, which they eagerly
ate out of their hands like bread. They are just as fond of
yak or sheep&rsquo;s flesh, and the Tibetans say that this diet
makes them tough and hardy. We cannot help liking
these small shaggy ponies, which live to no small extent
on the offal of game, are at home in the mountains, and
bear rarefied air with the greatest ease; their lungs are as
well adapted to it as those of the wild asses. The cold
does not trouble them in the least: they remain out all
through the night without a covering of any sort, and even
a temperature of &minus;22.7°, which we had on the night of
November 17, does not affect them. Though they are not
shod, they run deftly and securely up and down the slopes,
and the men on their backs look bigger than their horses.
We notice with great amusement how heartily they greet
each other at every camp. Puntsuk, who shows Muhamed
Isa the way, rides a small bay pony, which is already
grazing when we appear. As soon as the pony catches
sight of his grey comrade with Tsering Dava he neighs
with delight, cocks his ears, and runs up to him; and the
grey one exhibits just as much satisfaction. This is
very different from the conduct of our dogs, which fight
wildly as soon as they see each other.</p>

<p>Now we passed the Seoyinna mountain; one flank was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
dotted over by numerous wild yaks engaged in feeding,
and Tundup Sonam shot two. My men took the best
joints with them, the rest of the meat our guides would
fetch on their way home. They were evidently much
impressed by Tundup Sonam&rsquo;s skill, but Dava Tsering
declared that he had shot more than three hundred
yaks in his lifetime, which was probably no exaggeration,
seeing that these men live on the products of the
chase.</p>

<p>Now we ascend rapidly to the Chak-chom-la pass.
Tsering Dava rides in front. His little pony trots up the
ascent. When we have still a good distance to cover, we
see the profile of the man and his horse on the summit,
sharply defined against the sky. There stands a cairn of
granite blocks, and many trails of gold-diggers run at a
height of 17,825 feet. Sitting beside a fire, rendered
necessary by the cold and the wind, we gaze southwards over
a vast extent of country, a chaos of yellow, reddish, and
black crests. No plains appear between them, and we
suspect that we have troublesome ground before us. Near
at hand, towards the south-south-east, a flat basin with
a small lake occupies a large expanse. We ride down a
very steep path to the camp where the Tibetans proposed
a day&rsquo;s rest on behalf of the yaks we had purchased.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we settled accounts with our
guides, who had been so friendly and helpful, and who now
wished to return to their bare cold mountains where the
winds and wolves howl in rivalry. They received each
3 rupees a day as recompense, and a sheath-knife from
Kashmir, and a whole heap of empty tin cigarette-boxes,
which seemed to please them more than the money. And
then they vanished, swiftly and lightly as the wind, behind
the nearest hills, and we were alone again.</p>

<p>With 36 degrees of frost our nine Mohammedans
celebrated their &ldquo;Aid&rdquo; after Ramazan with flute, dance,
and song, and with a freshly slaughtered sheep. In the
night the thermometer fell to &minus;23°. The ink was always
freezing in my pen, even when I sat bending over the
brazier; after a few minutes my washing-basin contained
only a mass of ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span></p>

<p>After a few hours&rsquo; march we descried from a pass 22
grazing horses, 300 sheep, and some evidently tame yaks,
and these were near a tent. Farther to the west 500
sheep and a number of yaks were feeding. Five more
tents were pitched in a sheltered place in a deep valley,
and a troop of snarling dogs ran out to meet us. Men,
women, and children turned out to see what was the
matter. The caravan encamped near, on the western
shore of the lake Dungtsa-tso, and presently received a
visit from four Tibetans. These, too, came from Gertse,
had arrived ten days previously, and intended to stay three
months. The six tents contained 40 inmates, who possessed
together 1000 sheep, 60 yaks, and 40 horses. The
oldest of our new friends was a lame man of fifty-three years
of age, and was named Lobsang Tsering. He presented
to me a dish of sour milk and a bundle of joss-sticks, such
as are used in temples. He was willing to sell us three
large yaks for 23 rupees, and we took them without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>

<p>When the caravan had set out next morning two other
Tibetans presented themselves, very eager to sell us two
more yaks. When I told them that our money was on
in front, they asked permission to go with us to the next
camp, where the purchase might be completed. That
evening, then, we were the fortunate owners of ten
excellent yaks, and Tundup Sonam was appointed to be
their chief and leader. Our remaining mules and horses
now carried only very light loads, and I was rejoicing that
I could keep them all alive. But at this very spot another
mule was frozen to death; true, there were 59.2 degrees
of frost.</p>

<p>Our day&rsquo;s march ran round the lake and into a broad
valley extending in a south-easterly direction. Some 150
kulans were peacefully grazing among the tame yaks of
the nomads. A youth acted as guide to the caravan,
and old Lobsang Tsering rode like a herald before me,
mounted on a fine yellowish horse, which he would not
sell at any price. As he rode he muttered prayers at an
incredible pace&mdash;it sounded like the buzzing of a swarm
of midges about a lime tree on a summer evening. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
myself rode my dapple-grey from Yarkand again, in
order that my small white Ladaki might have a couple of
days&rsquo; rest.</p>

<p>The camp was pitched beside a pool of fresh water,
where the most wonderful sounds were emitted from the
firm ice all night long. It cracked and clappered, gurgled
and snorted like camels and yaks, and one might fancy
that a bevy of water-nymphs were dancing under the
icy roof. The dogs barked furiously at the ice till they at
last perceived that this noise must be put up with like
everything else.</p>

<p>At the evening fire Lobsang Tsering asked Muhamed
Isa whether we had met with Changpas at the Gomo. But
Muhamed Isa had promised Puntsuk and Tsering Dava
not to betray them. Then Lobsang winked an eye and
said that Islam Ahun had already told him that we had
not only seen nomads, but had bought yaks from them and
had taken them as guides for several days. Muhamed Isa
tried to turn the affair into a joke, and answered laughing
that Islam Ahun had concocted the story himself. But the
old man was sharp; he smiled cunningly, and seemed to
regard the first version as the more probable. It was a
great advantage to us that we had first come into contact
with Gertse nomads, who were themselves strangers in the
country we passed through. They had received no orders
from Lhasa concerning us, and were beyond all comparison
better disposed and more friendly than the eastern Tibetans,
who on my former journey had sent off messengers at once
to the south. But we now found that the Gertse nomads
were afraid of one another; the first had begged us to
tell no one that they had helped us, and had turned
back at the right moment in order not to be seen by their
fellow-tribesmen from Gertse.</p>

<p>Lobsang Tsering did not seem to be of a timid
disposition; he led us to other tents, gave us instructions
about the way to Bogtsang-tsangpo, and was able to
give us much interesting information. He told us, for
instance, that nearly four thousand sheep and several
hundred yaks are yearly employed in transporting salt
from the lakes we had lately passed, and that the salt was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
carried to Shigatse and Lhasa. From these towns came
most of the gold-diggers, and in the north were many other
gold-placers which we had not seen.</p>

<p>We soon perceived that Lobsang was a man of importance,
for all showed him the greatest respect, and we could
see from his camp that he was rich. He spoke with
dignity, and with an educated, refined accent. In his appearance
he reminded me of a decayed actor, without a trace
of beard, and with an animated expression in his dirty,
copper-coloured face. Unlike the rest, who wore sheepskin
caps, he sported a red turban, and his fur coat was
trimmed with red woollen stuff. In the front of his coat
all sorts of things were stuffed, among them a vile pocket-handkerchief&mdash;a
thick, coloured, square rag, constantly in
use, but never washed. There also he kept his snuff-horn,
which he could handle even in a wind with a
certain dexterity. The fine yellow snuff was scooped
up on the tip of the forefinger under the protection of
the thumb-nail, and conveyed to its destination somewhat
noisily.</p>

<p>Every evening Muhamed Isa made his report. This
time he presented himself with the following statement:
&ldquo;Sahib, Rehim Ali is still bad, and he begs permission to
offer a sheep to Allah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, if he will be any the better for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, certainly, Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is all humbug, but it will do him no harm
and the Mohammedans will get an extra meal. I will give
the sheep then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sahib, that will not do; then the sacrifice would
have no effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. Can I have the kidneys for dinner to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sahib, only Mohammedans may eat of a sheep
offered in sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so; of course in your opinion I am a <i>kaper</i>&rdquo;
(heathen).</p>

<p>He laughingly protested, but changed the subject.
&ldquo;Now we have 13 mules and 11 horses, or 27 animals
altogether, of the original caravan.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirteen and eleven make only twenty-four,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! then I must count them again,&rdquo; said my conscientious
caravan leader, and he gave himself much
unnecessary trouble to make the figures agree. At last it
proved that we had still twenty-five animals beside the
yaks.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XVI</p>

<p class="center chap2">OUR FORTUNES ON THE WAY TO THE BOGTSANG-TSANGPO</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">During</span> the preceding five days we had covered forty-two
miles in a direction 33 degrees east of south, and on
November 22 travelled a little farther on the same course.
We are now on a great, easily recognizable road, consisting
of about fifty paths running parallel to one another, which
have been worn by the sheep of the salt caravans and the
yaks of the gold-diggers. In the country Kebechungu,
where nomads were encamped, our new friends turned
back. In this part of Tibet the sharply-defined configuration
of the mountains occurring farther east, where
longitudinal valleys alternate with lateral ranges, does
not prevail. Here one travels day after day among
crowded hills of gentle outline, and small, level expanses
are much less common. No lofty commanding mountain
masses rise above this maze, and the eye searches in vain
for the isolated, glaciated summits seen in East Tibet.</p>

<p>The weather had been quite calm during the season of
severe cold, but when the storms returned at night, the
temperature fell only to &minus;4.7° Next day it was hard
riding. We marched to the south-south-east in a strong
south-west storm, and were almost suffocated in the gusts of
dust-laden air which swept along the ground. We suffer
greatly and cannot use our hands, the map-sheet is torn in
pieces, and we wonder if we shall live to reach the next
camp. Our faces are distorted and assume quite a different
expression, for we involuntarily draw the facial muscles
together in the wind, to protect the eyes, producing a
quantity of fresh wrinkles which are filled with white dust.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
The eyes are bloodshot and water, tears run down the
cheeks, catch the dust, and freeze. The lips swell and
burst, and the skin round the nails cracks so that the finger-tips
bleed.</p>

<p>At last, more dead than alive, we reach the camp, where
the men have, with great exertion, set up Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s
tent, and after many attempts have induced the fire to
burn, which, now that it has caught, blazes with flickering
tongues of flame and scatters sparks all round into the
gyrations of the whirlwind. We hasten to restore our
circulation, but that takes time. By degrees our facial
muscles recover their elasticity and return to their proper
position, and we regain our former aspect; there is no
longer a twitch at the corners of our mouths when we
laugh, though, indeed, we have precious little cause for
laughter. Half-a-dozen of our remaining mules come up,
attracted by the warmth. Sonam Tsering wishes to drive
them away, but I let the poor frozen creatures stay. The
fewer they become, the more carefully we look after the
survivors, and are always hoping to reach more hospitable
country. There is, indeed, little hope of it; the barley
and maize are almost consumed, and there is only one sack
of rice left.</p>

<p>In such nights one longs for a warm bed. The noise
outside is as though artillery waggons were racing over a
pavement of undressed stones. The wind comes in gusts
as though driven by pulsations. A gust is heard whistling
through the grass and dying away in the distance, only to
be followed by another which rushes down the mountains
like a waterfall, and seems determined to carry away the
tent with it in its headlong flight. One does not look back
with regret on the day now drawing to a close, but longs to
get away&mdash;away from the Chang-tang.</p>

<p>November 24. In a month it will be Christmas Eve.
Shall we remain together so long? At the former camp the
animals had no water, and at to-day&rsquo;s camping-place
also we found nothing but hard ice at the mouth of a very
narrow gorge, and consequently two mules passed away in
the night, and a third followed them in the morning. My
dapple-grey was suffering; I now rode a tall, yellowish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
horse which had carried the boat, and afterwards the box
of cooking utensils. The latter was transferred to a mule,
but he died before the next camp and a horse had to fetch
the box.</p>

<p>Four mules in one day! We had now only eight.
The yaks, the splendid yaks, carried all the baggage.
When we left the bodies a troop of wolves sneaked out of
the ravines. Islam Ahun, who had travelled with Robert
and myself since Rehim Ali&rsquo;s adventure, tried to frighten
them away, but in vain. Four great vultures had already
mutilated one of the corpses; they must have begun early,
for they were already satiated, and staggered slowly away
as we rode past. The ravens waited at some distance for
their turn to come.</p>

<p>Of 58 horses and 36 mules, 12 and 8 respectively now
remained. The ratio between the survivors was therefore
nearly the same as between the original numbers. It would,
however, be hasty to infer that mules are as efficient as horses
in the highlands of Tibet. Had we had small, tough Sanskar
horses in the place of the Yarkand horses, the result would
certainly have been in favour of the horses. On the other
hand, our mules came from Poonch. Had we had Tibetan
mules, they would probably have held out better than the
horses. But Tibetan mules are seldom to be found in Ladak.</p>

<p>Lower down the valley we came to a <i>mani-ringmo</i>, a
stone cist covered with <i>mani</i> slabs, and our men became
quite lively at the sight, for it reminded them of their home.
We rode up a height with an extensive view. To the
south-east appeared rather a large lake, begirt with white
fields of gypsum and terraces. Crossing three rocky ridges
running out to its western shore, we reached the southern
bank, where we encamped. This must be the Rinakchutsen
(&ldquo;The hot spring of the Black Mountain&rdquo;), for
every detail agreed with the description given us by
Lobsang Tsering.</p>

<p>The date is November 25, the day I had fixed on, when
with Colonel Dunlop Smith, as the most likely date of our
arrival at the Dangra-yum-tso. The post must therefore
be at the lake long before us. The post? We did not
know whether we should find on the shore a hospitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
tent or an impenetrable wall of soldiers and horses and a
fence of matchlocks.</p>

<p>This is the lake which Dutreuil de Rhins discovered in
1893 and named &ldquo;Lac Ammoniac.&rdquo; We did not cross his
route, for he skirted the lake on the east, we on the west
side. But just to the south of the lake we crossed Bower&rsquo;s
route of the year 1891. We shall again remain for some
days in unknown country until we intersect Littledale&rsquo;s
track of the year 1895, mine of 1901, and Nain Sing&rsquo;s of
1873.</p>

<p>In the night the temperature sank to &minus;27.8°, the greatest
cold we had hitherto experienced. We were, however,
advancing southwards to lower regions. Though the
winter still continued, it could scarcely bring us lower
temperatures. For four days we travelled towards the
noonday sun, slowly marching over passes and through
winding valleys, over small plains, where kiangs enjoyed
their free delightful life, over a hard-frozen river, and by
springs, round which emerald-green ice glittered in the
sun, past a flock of sheep and four tents, and finally we
emerged on to an open plain, enclosed by mountains, which
sloped towards the south and contained in the middle a lake
nearly dried up, where the crystallized salt and gypsum
emitted a brilliancy like that of fresh-fallen snow.</p>

<p>The country was called Mogbo-dimrop; at the foot of
the red mountains we descried six black tents surrounded
by stone walls. Namgyal and Tundup Sonam found only
eight inhabitants, children, boys, and old men, for the strong
men and women had gone out with the cattle. These
nomads belonged to the province of Naktsang, and were
under the rule of the Devashung, the Government in Lhasa,
and therefore could give us no information about the country
near the Dangra-yum-tso, where the nomads are under the
administration of Tashi-lunpo. They would be very glad
to sell us yaks and sheep if we would be so good as to wait
here till the next day.</p>

<p>Then Muhamed Isa went off to the tents, and came
back full of gloomy forebodings. An elderly man from a
neighbouring group of tents had come to warn the others.
He had declared in sharp commanding tones: &ldquo;We know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
that you have a European with you, and to such our land
is closed. We cannot stop you at present, but we shall
take care not to sell you yaks or sheep, and we cannot give
you any information. It would be better for you to make
haste back again, or you will get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are on the way to the Tashi Lama, who is expecting
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we have nothing to do with the Tashi Lama; we
are under the direct rule of the Government in Lhasa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tundup Sonam, who had also gone to the tents,
noticed that two youths were absent, and was convinced
that they had been despatched as express messengers to
the nearest <i>Bombo</i> or chief, in the south. We must therefore
make all haste to reach a district which was under the
control of Tashi-lunpo.</p>

<p>Later on a wanderer came to our camp. He was ragged
and miserable, and said that he was one of a party of 35
pilgrims from Nakchu, who with 600 sheep and 100
yaks had visited the holy lake and mountain in Ngari-korsum,
and were now on their way home to Nakchu, where
they would arrive in three months. The pilgrimage
takes two years or more to accomplish, for the people
remain for days, and often weeks, together where there is
good pasturage. They followed the north side of the
Chargut-tso along an old established pilgrim route.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">89. <span class="sc">&rdquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; they asked me.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>We broke up our camp early on December 1, with a
temperature of &minus;24.2°, which cost us the loss of another
mule. He was at once devoured by the wolves, which were
so bold that they did not go away when we rode past. When
we had accomplished about half our march we came to a
tent of which two snappy light yellow dogs seemed to be
the only masters. But no doubt the inmates were afraid to
show themselves, and examined us only through their spy-holes.
Near this day&rsquo;s camp there were more tents, and my
usual dealers obtained two yaks, three sheep, and a can of
dirty milk. Before the Tibetans would deal, they first inquired
whether there was not a <i>Peling</i> (a European) in our
party, and declared that they would visit our camp to convince
themselves that such was not the case. The answer
given them was that the principal personage in our company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
was a <i>Kalun</i>, or high official, from Ladak, and that we had
several dangerous dogs. On that they gave up their visit.
But when we started off two of them were present, one of
whom Muhamed Isa took as a guide. The other remained
standing by us and looked at me, trying to find out whether
I was a <i>Peling</i> or a <i>Kalun</i>. He was certainly doubtful,
for he looked exceedingly disturbed as we rode off.</p>

<p>This day Robert and I lost our way. We had taken
the Hajji as guide, but he lost the trail, and stupidly
wandered about aimlessly. As he had to seek for the track
again, we settled down on an open space beside a fire,
while the storm roared above our heads and dark threatening
snow-clouds swept over the mountains to the north. At
last Muhamed Isa became uneasy and sent out scouts, who
at length found us out.</p>

<p>Camp No. 77 was situated in the higher part of a
lateral valley, where a spring was frozen into huge clumps
of ice. At the fire we encountered two strangers in red
turbans, round which their locks were twisted, with ivory
rings, silver image cases, and fur coats trimmed with red
and green ribands; they were armed with sabres encased
in silver-mounted scabbards, richly encrusted with inferior
coral and turquoise; they wore new coloured felt boots,
and had their black muskets hanging from their shoulders.
They belonged to the troop of pilgrims from Nakchu. Our
Ladakis, however, were convinced that they were come to
spy upon us. If we seemed too strong for them, they
would only ask&mdash;as, in fact, happened&mdash;if we had anything
to sell; otherwise they would steal our horses. Meanwhile
they behaved very civilly, were exceedingly friendly, and
promised to return next morning with some yaks and
sheep, which we might buy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will remain near you till it is dark and will return
before daybreak, for if any one saw us trading with a <i>Peling</i>,
we should pay dearly for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid, we shall not betray you,&rdquo; I
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you did betray us, Bombo Chimbo, we should
not be easily caught. There are many pilgrims on the way
to the holy mountain Kang-rinpoche (Kailas).&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be quite at ease. Come with your animals,
and you shall be well paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. But tell me, are you not the <i>Peling</i> who came
five years ago with two companions to Nakchu, and was
compelled by the Governor to turn back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not see you ourselves, but all the province
was talking about you, and you had Shereb Lama as a
guide. You had also a large caravan with camels and
several Russians in your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you remember all that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was repeatedly said that it would be a marvel
if you escaped the robbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I clearly perceived from this not very flattering popularity
that, if the common people were so well informed of
my doings, the authorities would find it easy to follow my
track. Now the Tibetans knew that it was I, and no one
else, who was penetrating to the heart of the forbidden
land. How speedily this fact would be transmitted to the
south! How quickly would the Devashung bring us to a
halt! Where would our grand progress come to a standstill,
checked by a peremptory &ldquo;Thus far and no farther,&rdquo;
backed up by muzzle-loaders and sabres? Ah, where
would my dreams again be shattered and my aspirations
cease to pulsate?</p>

<p>In the morning, when the pilgrims had returned, I was
waked early and went out to view the market that had
been created in the wilderness as by an enchanter&rsquo;s wand.
The sun had not yet risen above the mountains, the camp
lay in icy-cold shadow, and the air was dull and raw. The
smoke circled round the fires in suffocating density, and
through it I saw six splendid yaks with wooden saddles.
The Tibetans in their picturesque costume, with sabres
jingling at their sides, knives and amulets, gesticulated
vehemently, and in a torrent of well-chosen words extolled
the exceptional qualities of the grunting oxen. The result
of the affair was that all six yaks passed into our possession,
and we also bought two packets of brick-tea, a bag
of Bhotan tobacco, and a couple of bladders of butter.
Robert piled up the shining silver coins in rows at the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
of my tent, and the eyes of the Tibetans shone with delight
at the sight of so much money, and at hearing the ring of
the silver. An empty tin and a tin cigarette box found
their way, as usual, into the front of their fur coats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the way to the south?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are disposed to accompany us, you shall receive
three rupees a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should like to, but we dare not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard that to the south of this pass the
country has been roused and that soldiers are being collected
to render your further journey impossible. We must
go quickly northwards. Our people are already ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you think that the soldiers are waiting for
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That no one knows, but it is certain that they are
gathering together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, in your opinion, do they mean to do with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will prevent you going farther southwards, but
will do you no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the Bombo Chimbo was friendly last time,
and did not refuse to march westwards when he was
required to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way will they ask us to take this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably the same as before, to Ladak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silver money rattled in the tin boxes as they
mounted and disappeared down the valley, while we, now
owners of eighteen fine yaks, struggled laboriously up the
small steep pass overlooking camp No. 77. We had a
wide view southwards over side ranges separated from one
another by broad valleys. But it was not long before
heavy snow drove us away. Numbed with cold, we rode
down to the level country.</p>

<p>From the plain the Hajji pointed back to the pass,
where three riders showed black against the snow; they
rode down at a smart trot and soon overtook us. Their
black, snorting horses steamed, they carried guns at their
shoulder-belts, and sabres in their girdles. Their reddish-purple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
mantles were rolled up on the saddle behind them,
and they rode in sheepskins, black and greasy from the
soot of camp-fires, and the blood and fat of slaughtered
game, which in the course of years had hardened into a
smooth crust intersected with cracks. As we were the
object of their ride, they followed at our heels, slackened
their pace, and rode up to my side. A coarse fellow asked
shortly and boldly (Illustration 89):</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pilgrims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Ladak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither are you travelling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Dangra-yum-tso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People from Ladak never come from the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite possible, but we come from the north.
Where have you been yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With relatives who are camping to the east. We
have two more days&rsquo; journey before we reach home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they spurred their horses and rode after the
caravan, which was encamped at the foot of a rock. Here
they let their horses graze, behaved as though they were
at home, and subjected Muhamed Isa to the same cross-examination.
Shortly before sunset they rode off westwards.
We had an uncomfortable feeling that something
ominous, something decisive, was brewing, and that our
fate might perhaps be settled next day. For it was clear
as day that the men must have been spies. They were a
patrol of the numerous express messengers sent into all the
valleys by orders from Lhasa to beat up the men fit for
military service. Soon these incorruptible riders would
crop up like mushrooms from the ground.</p>

<p>The camp No. 78 and the weather were in harmony
with our mood as we awaited our fate. There was no
pasturage, only ice, and the fuel was scanty. Opaque
clouds obscured the sky, snow was falling on the mountains,
the north-west storm moaned round the corners, and
whirled the ashes and scraps of dung about so that they
found their way into my tent, where the dogs lay rolled in
a corner to keep themselves warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span></p>

<p>Again, on December 4, we left a mule behind. The
land was covered with snow, and the ride was fearfully
cold, icicles hung from my moustache, and my right foot
lost all feeling. Hundreds of antelopes and kiangs were
grazing to the left of our road; the dogs dashed at them,
but soon came back again, for the animals would not move
an inch. No men appeared, and we thought that the real
opposition would be encountered at the Bogtsang-tsangpo,
that is, where I had last time been forced to turn westwards.</p>

<p>The next day&rsquo;s march took us over rather tiring hills
where small points of weathered porphyry cropped up here
and there out of the ground. Spoors of wild animals ran
in all directions, and cattle and sheep tracks were equally
numerous.</p>

<p>But not even at the Bogtsang-tsangpo did anything
suspicious appear. We calmed down again and rested here
on the 6th. Our store of rice and flour was consumed;
there was only a little for me, so that I had my freshly-baked
bread every morning and evening. The others had to
live exclusively on mutton, so that every day one sheep
at least was needed. Just as Tundup Sonam and two
other men returned from a foray, bringing with them six
fat sheep, we saw six men on foot coming to our camp.
Our grand vizier, Muhamed Isa, received them before they
were brought before me. The principal among them thus
introduced himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the <i>Gova</i> (District Chief) of this country, and
have received tidings from the north that you are on the
way southwards. You passed through here five years ago
with twenty-five camels. I am now come to inquire your
name, how many servants and pack-animals you have, and
whither you intend to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you put these questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I must forward information to the Governor
of Naktsang; if I do not, he will cut my head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was given the particulars he wanted, and then he
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will the Bombo Chimbo be so kind as to wait here
until the answer comes back?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the Governor of Naktsang?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Shansa-dzong on the Kyaring-tso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will it take a messenger to reach him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the answer will be here in twenty days. No,
thank you, we have no time to wait so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must wait three days, until I have sent for a
man who can write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we are off to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far all had passed off well. Instead of encountering
an armed force, we found the country open for twenty
days longer. But after that things would be different; the
Governor of Naktsang would not let me take another step
farther southwards; I knew him in the year 1901 and
found him inflexible. The least we could expect was that
he would detain us till the answer of the Government was
received. Like Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard, I should
have to wait one, perhaps even two, months.</p>

<p>Our chief, however, pursued a little private policy of
his own, and said that the relations of the Devashung and
India were now friendly, and therefore he would treat us
as friends. He dared not sell us baggage animals or
provide us with guides without the consent of the
Governor, but he would gladly impart to us all the information
we desired. He mentioned some names
according with those given by Nain Sing, and showing
how conscientiously the celebrated Pundit had performed
his task. The conical height to the north of our camp he
named Tugu-lhamo; the Gobrang is a ridge to the north-east
of it, and a side valley is called Ragok. Nain Sing
gives the names Dubu Lhamo, Gobrang, and Ragu. He
reckons the distance to the Dagtse-tso, the salt lake by
which I encamped in 1901 at the mouth of the Bogtsang-tsangpo,
at nine days&rsquo; journey. It is easily explained how
Nain Sing fell into an error here, and also represented the
river as flowing into the Chargut-tso, for he was not there
himself and trusted too much to the frequently unreliable
information of the chiefs.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening the chief became still more
friendly, and proposed to travel with us for three days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
under the pretence of keeping an eye on us. He would,
however, keep some distance from us, and, like a night-owl,
join us only when it had become quite dark. In the
night he pitched his chieftain&rsquo;s tent, green above and white
below, beside ours.</p>

<p>We passed quickly eastwards along the Bogtsang-tsangpo
in only five and a half short marches, partly
close beside the river, partly along parallel valleys which
skirt its southern bank. On December 7 we lost sight of
it, but in the district Pati-bo it again emerged from a
narrow transverse valley. Eastwards the fall is extremely
slight, and the river winds in most capricious curves, so that
the path touches the bank only at the southern bends.
A quantity of hearthstones and fenced-in sheepfolds show
that many nomads spend the summer on the Bogtsang-tsangpo.
The volume of water is very insignificant, for
the river is principally fed by sources which are called into
existence only by the autumn rains, and fail in winter.
Thick ice lies over it all, and is deeply hollowed by the
constant fall of the river. The ranges on both sides run in
an east and west direction, and frequently three such crests
are seen at the same time towards the south. One is
often astonished at the whim of the stream in turning
sharply to cut through a rocky crest, whereas it would
seem much easier to flow on along the open longitudinal
valley. But, like most mountainous countries, Tibet
presents many such puzzling problems, difficult of solution.
At a place where comparatively warm rivulets flow in on
our side there is a short, wide reach of the river where
Robert caught fish, a very welcome variation in our
monotonous diet.</p>

<p>In the night we had 54 degrees of frost, and on
December 12 the thermometer sank to &minus;24.7°. The
caravan now consisted of 11 horses and 4 mules, besides
the 18 yaks. The yaks are not accustomed to long
day&rsquo;s marches, so we proceeded very slowly eastwards.
We could not hurry our marches, much as we should have
liked to do so. There were several men sickly, and
the medicine chest was in great demand. Muhamed
Isa especially suffered from headache, and many a time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
as we passed by he was lying on his back on the ground.
He was dosed with antipyrine and quinine, and I advised
him to walk as little as possible.</p>

<p>The chief became more and more at home with us, and
no longer observed his former caution. He sometimes
called on nomads on the way, but his tent was always set
up among ours. Every day he brought to me one or two
nomads, who gave me information about the country and
sold us milk and sheep. Several were from Ombo, a
village and district on the north shore of the Dangra-yum-tso,
where a couple of stone huts stand and barley is
cultivated. The pasturage round the lake is said to be so
poor that the inhabitants of its shores have to migrate northwards
with their flocks in winter. Unfortunately they had
not heard of a post messenger from Shigatse, but they
were equally ignorant of any order directed against us.</p>

<p>On December 12 we left the Bogtsang-tsangpo and
directed our steps towards the south-east. At night a
violent storm arose, but the minimum temperature was
only 13.5°; the night before there were 56.7 degrees of
frost.</p>

<p>Another mule died in the night, and the surviving
animals had to be carefully guarded from the wolves, which
were unusually daring. We started on December 13 to
the pass La-ghyanyak (16,932 feet high), where a pyramidal
cairn marks the divide between the Bogtsang-tsangpo
and the Dangra-yum-tso. The former can be
seen meandering along its valley to its termination in
the lake Dagtse-tso; the latter is not yet visible, but we
can guess where its basin lies among the huge mountain
massives. Yonder lay the holy lake Dangra-yum-tso,
which had long been our aim, and whither I had requested
Colonel Dunlop Smith to send my letters. To the south-west
arose two dominating snowy peaks above a sea of
mountainous undulations, and in the same direction lay
a small round lake, the Tang-yung-tsaka, already seen
by Nain Sing, and named by him Tang-yung-tso
(Illustration 90). The country seemed desolate and uninhabited,
and no riders spurred through the valleys to
block our way. Farther down we passed two tents, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
the inmates told us we were on the wrong way if we wished
to go to the Dangra-yum-tso, for it could be reached in a
direction due south in four short marches. All Naktsang
knew, they said, that a <i>Peling</i> was coming, a report that,
however, had probably spread from the north, not from
the south. If the mail-runner had actually reached the
lake, he would hear that we were not far off, and would
look out for us.</p>

<p>Now the thermometer sank to &minus;24° again, and we let
the animals rest a day. Meanwhile I, with Robert and
Shukkur Ali, made an excursion on foot through a
singularly wild romantic valley, which was little over a
yard broad in some places, and was cut out between
vertical walls. Often the bottom is filled with fallen
blocks, which obstruct the way, but elsewhere it is occupied
by a brook, now frozen up. The rapids and waterfalls of
this brook are also congealed into glassy ice, and shine
with a bluish-green tinge in the depth of the valley,
where the summer flood has excavated curious caves.
Here the wind is confined as in a pair of bellows, and
roars and whistles round the cliffs. In an expansion of
the valley we kindle a fire and take a rest. Along the
precipice above us six proud eagles soar with motionless
wings.</p>

<p>According to previous arrangement Rabsang came
to meet us with some of our yaks, so that we could ride
back. He brought us disturbing news. At the tents we had
seen farther up the valley on the day before, twelve armed
men had collected to waylay us. An express messenger
had, it seems, brought word from Shigatse that we must
be driven back to the north. I did not question him
further, and we rode home in silence. It was a bitter experience
now, when we had looked down from La-ghanyak
on the great unknown country crossed only by Nain Sing&rsquo;s
route of the year 1874, which we had intended to intersect
at one point only, to see all the grand discoveries, of which
I had dreamt so long, blown away like mist. And it was
especially irritating to think that others might come here
later and rob me of these conquests. Reminiscences of
the past autumn and early winter came into my head; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
had successfully executed an immense traverse over the
Chang-tang, and at the critical moment the nomads had
come to our assistance. It had been a splendid bold
journey hitherto, but I had always considered it only as
a prologue to the grand plans which kept me awake at
night and had occupied my thoughts during the long
weary ride. And now they would receive their death-blow.
Now my dreams of victory would be resolved into blue
haze, like the smoke of the camp-fire which marked the
southernmost point of our advance into the forbidden land.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XVII</p>

<p class="center chap2">CHRISTMAS IN THE WILDS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Much</span> depressed but outwardly composed, I dismounted
from the yak and entered my tent just as Tsering brought
in the brazier. The tent seemed more dismal than usual,
the brazier made me feel weary, and at this moment I
seemed to realize how lonely and dull my life had been all
through the winter; but Tsering was as tranquil as usual,
and raked the fire with the tongs to remove some still
smoking dung.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you see that I was right; how often have I
told you that we should be ordered to halt at the Bogtsang-tsangpo?&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ordered to halt?&rdquo; exclaimed Tsering in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now we are stuck fast, but I will not move a step
from the spot until the Tibetans have provided me with a
new caravan, though I have to wait all the winter. Then we
will go north-eastwards, look for the Mongolian pilgrim
road, and hasten to Pekin. I will force the Mandarins
to allow me to see the parts of Tibet where no European
has yet been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand what the Sahib means; hitherto
no one has hindered us, and the country southwards lies
open before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? Have they not come
this very day to stop our further progress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, on the contrary, three Tibetans are sitting with
Muhamed Isa, and they are most civil and friendly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has, then, Rabsang played a trick on me and the Babu
Sahib?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied Tsering, laughing, &ldquo;now I understand
the matter. Rabsang was up at the tents this morning,
and allowed himself to be frightened by a Tibetan, who
told him that we should be forced to remain where we are,
for we had no right to travel southwards to Naktsang.
But that was only the Tibetan&rsquo;s own notion, and Rabsang,
who had to go immediately after to the valley
with the yaks, had not heard how matters really stood
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Tsering, slay the fattest sheep we have got,
and invite every one to a feast. I will have the kidneys
fried in their own fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the storm-beaten tent seemed more comfortable
and the brazier sent out a pleasant kindly heat. I sat
buried in thought, wondering whether this were a good
omen, when Muhamed Isa announced a visit of the three
Tibetans. I invited them to take a seat at the fire.
Turning to the chief man, who wore a blood-red fur
coat and a brick-red fox-skin cap, I asked him who he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Karma Tamding from Tang-yung,&rdquo; he answered;
and I was astonished that he gave his name at once, for
the Tibetans are generally shy of doing so, lest they should
bring upon themselves retaliation on the part of their
superiors when their names are known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are, then, in the province of Tang-yung?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bombo Chimbo, the pass you crossed yesterday
is its northern boundary; to the west Tang-yung extends
for three days&rsquo; journey, and as far to the east, and southwards
to the Dangra-yum-tso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you come to my tent, Karma Tamding?
Has one of your superiors sent you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but idle rumours have been current here for some
time. First it was an old woman, who would have it that
two hundred men were coming down from the north.
Large bands of robbers from Nakchu have plundered the
nomads in the north, and we felt sure that they were
robbers who were coming into our country. The day
before yesterday we heard that it was only a peaceful
European, who took, indeed, yaks, sheep, butter, and milk
from our people, but always paid well for them. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
now come to see our guests with my own eyes, and I am
very glad to find you instead of a robber band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not heard, then, that any messenger from
Shigatse has been inquiring about us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not a word. But this very day I have heard that
an express has been sent from the Bogtsang-tsangpo to
Shansa-dzong, and that messengers will travel thence to
Lhasa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be so good as to sell us yaks, Karma Tamding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, willingly. I saw you five years ago at the
Bogtsang-tsangpo. Then you were conducted over the
frontier by a large escort and two officers, but now
Europeans seem to be privileged to pass through the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you procure us guides?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but which way do you think of taking? If
you wish to go to the Dangra-yum-tso, you must cross the
Kam-la, which lies a little farther up this valley. But if
you prefer the route to the Ngangtse-tso, you must travel on
eastwards. It is all the same to us which way you take,
but I must know for certain. I will ride back to my tent
and fetch parched meal, which you can buy when I overtake
you in a few days. The yaks I will send to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karma Tamding seemed so trustworthy that I handed
him half the purchase money in advance, and the next day
we bought 3 yaks at 20 rupees a head, and received a
guide, who conducted us over two difficult passes, eastwards
to the Rara country, and on December 16 over the
Pike-la, a gap in a longitudinal valley running parallel to
the Bogtsang-tsangpo.</p>

<p>We were compelled to camp early by one of our three
mules, which could not travel any farther. He came up
to the fire with trembling legs and laid himself down.
&ldquo;The news of his death will be the first I shall hear in the
morning,&rdquo; I thought, but I had not to wait so long, for
before the stars had begun to twinkle he lay stiff and cold
in the smoke of the camp-fire. Only two of the Poonch
mules were left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span></p>

<p>Then Karma Tamding rode up with twelve other
Tibetans, two of them women. They sat down by the fire
and looked at me; and I looked at them. The older woman
had a fine sheepskin, and on the forehead an ornament of
pendent coral and silver coins from Lhasa. The younger
was similarly dressed, and had a huge lambskin cap. Little
could be seen of her, but the little that was visible was
dirty beyond belief. The men were strongly built and
well proportioned&mdash;one could perceive that, when they
drew off the right sleeve and exposed their breasts to the
heat of the fire.</p>

<p>When we had gazed at one another long enough, and I
had learned that the small lake near by was called the Tarmatse-tso,
the whole party crawled into Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tent
to offer their edibles for sale. And there parched meal and
barley was bought to the value of 68 rupees; it was quite
a pleasure to see with what an appetite our last twelve
animals emptied their bags of barley; they had so long
had to put up with the execrable grass of the desert.</p>

<p>Next day we took leave of honest Karma Tamding.
&ldquo;On the boundary of Naktsang you will meet with an
elderly man, named Chabga Namgyal, who is just as nice
as I am,&rdquo; were his last words. We continued our long
winter journey through Tibet eastwards along the same
convenient longitudinal valley, and bivouacked in the district
Neka, an ominous name (it means in Swedish to
refuse), which might perhaps have brought us bad luck
had the supreme chief of Tang-yung, whose headquarters
are here, been at home at the time. Fortunately he had a
short time before set out with his wife and children to
Tashi-lunpo for the New Year festival, and had consigned
his large herd of yaks and flock of sheep to the care of his
servants and his herdsmen. They sold us milk and butter,
but disapproved of my disturbing the gentle fish in a neighbouring
pool. Within an hour I had twenty-five on dry land,
which were a great treat at dinner. Robert had been unwell
for some days, and now developed high fever, which
confined him to his bed. Sonam Tsering suffered from a
curious mountain sickness, in consequence of which all his
body swelled up and assumed a livid hue. Two others were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
unwell, and the medicine chest stood open again. Sonam
Tsering&rsquo;s tent was like an hospital, where all the sick found
shelter as soon as they were incapacitated. Only old
Guffaru was still healthy, did the work of two, and had
at present no use for the shroud he brought from Leh.
His large white beard had turned yellow in the smoke of
the fires, and his hands, frost-bitten in winter, were dark
and hard as iron. We stayed two days in camp No. 90,
to give the invalids a rest. My dapple-grey from Yarkand
was nearly drowned in a spring; fortunately he was
seen from the camp, and ten strong men pulled him out of
the mud. Then he was dried at the fire, rubbed well
down, and covered with cloths. But his days were
numbered.</p>

<p>On December 20 we ride on along the longitudinal
valley parallel to the Bogtsang-tsangpo, and encamp at
the mouth of a transverse valley, which belongs to the
southern mountains, and is called Kung-lung. Frozen
springs are seen on all sides; the farther we advance
southwards the more the country is fertilized by the
monsoon rains. The ground is honeycombed by millions
of mouse holes; they are so close together that there is no
room for more. The field-mouse here does the work of
loosening and ploughing up the ground that the worm
does in our soil. But the herbage derives no benefit from
it, for the mice subsist on the roots and destroy the
grass.</p>

<p>When we had passed the boundary between Tang-yung
and Naktsang, and had just pitched our camp at the source
of the brook draining the Kung-lung valley, three riders
with guns suddenly appeared, who were making for the
same spot, and behind them came a dark group, perhaps
soldiers. Probably they were about to arrest us here, at
the first camp in Naktsang. No; another false alarm.
They were simply peasants from the Bogtsang-tsangpo,
who had been to Naktsang to barter salt for <i>tsamba</i>
(parched meal) and barley, and were now on their homeward
journey. The troop consisted of members of several
tent villages, among which the goods would be distributed.
The <i>tsamba</i> and the barley were carried by yaks, horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
and sheep, and seemed sufficient to last many households
all the winter.</p>

<p>Here I heard for the first time of the lake Shuru-tso,
but I little thought that I should bivouac on its shore next
spring. The range on the north, in which the Keva is the
highest summit, is the water-parting between the Dagtse-tso
and the Kung-tso, a lake visible to the east. On the south
we had the range which we had first seen at the Dangra-yum-tso,
and which afterwards skirts the south side of the
Tang-yung-tso.</p>

<p>In the night the continued westerly storm increased to
a hurricane, which blew down my tent. It was fastened
up again, but at dawn I was awakened by a report like a
gunshot, for one of the strained tent ropes broke, and
another tore itself out of its iron cap, which fell with a
sharp clatter against the tent. A shower of stones and
coarse sand beat about my airy dwelling, so that it required
a certain amount of resolution to issue forth in weather
worse than we had experienced in Chang-tang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much longer will the storm last?&rdquo; I asked our
guide, as he joyfully and thankfully pocketed his 18 rupees
after he had handed us over to another guide of the Naktsang
tribe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six months,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>We marched eastwards, gradually diverging to the
south, and thus passed round the chain which had hitherto
lain on our right. On the way we found Adul in a
hollow, and asked him how he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am dying,&rdquo; he answered, without moving a muscle.
I sent one of his comrades and a horse from the camp to
bring in his corpse, but next morning he was as lively as a
cricket. Such weather is certainly not enjoyable, but it is no
use to complain of wind and weather. My horse staggers
about as if he had drunk too much. At the opening of
every lateral valley we may be sure of a buffet that will
make us reel in our saddles. We bend sideways against
the wind to help the horse in maintaining his equilibrium,
and we draw ourselves together so as to present a smaller
surface to the wind&mdash;indeed, we are like a sail that must
always be set according to the direction of the wind, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
we have to trim ourselves just as one would handle a
sailing-boat in a high sea. We rested awhile in the
shelter of a rock, to recover our breath, and when at length
we reached the camp in Nadsum we had suffered as much
as we were able to bear. To the north-east, beyond the
mountains, lies the Dagtse-tso, which Bower, Dutreuil de
Rhins, Littledale, and I have visited; on the way thither
a lake is passed, called the Goang-tso.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we took our way to the south, where a range
of considerable height bars the road to the Ngangtse-tso.
We followed the river Sertsang-chu upwards; a little water
still bubbled and trickled down under its thick covering of
ice. In the evening we received a visit from eight Tibetans,
two of whom had lost all their yaks by a kind of cattle-plague.
We ascended the same valley for another day&rsquo;s
journey, and found five tents in an expansion of the valley
which was called Torno-shapko; at several spots we saw
large flocks of sheep guarded by dogs as snappy and
impudent as the nomads themselves. Some of these
fellows came into our camp and used very rude language,
daring even to say that we must not remain here but must
pack off with all speed. To buy milk and butter was out
of the question. Muhamed Isa drove them away and
threatened to report their conduct to the Governor of
Naktsang. Our guide, a boy of fifteen, was frightened,
but was persuaded to accompany us a day longer.</p>

<p>December 24. When I woke an old mendicant lama
sat singing before my tent. He had a little withered
woman with him, and their small light tent was pitched
quite close to us. In his hand he held a staff bedecked
with coloured strips and with brass plates, coral, shells,
tassels, and other ornaments, which he made to spin round
as he sang. The old man had in his lifetime wandered far
and wide, begging his way from tent to tent, but when I
asked him to accompany us and to bring in the Christmas
festival with song at our camp at night he declared he was
too tired.</p>

<p>The road led us higher up the same valley, soon leaving
the sources behind. We passed two <i>manis</i> with prayers
inscribed on the slabs, one of which was 23 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
long. Two tents stood at a spot where two large valleys
converged. The unfriendly men we had met yesterday
had gone on before us and had warned the people not to
sell us anything if we asked them. Two of our men tried
to trade, but met with a refusal, whereupon Muhamed Isa
laid his riding-whip smartly across the backs of the mischief-makers.
Then the whole company fell on their knees,
became remarkably civil, and brought out at once all the
butter and milk they had on hand.</p>

<p>Our valley now runs eastwards, and at last rises in a
south-easterly direction to a pass. Evidently no great road
runs over it, for there is no cairn on the summit. It turned
out later that the youth had led us astray, omitting to turn
aside through a southern valley to the pass Gurtse-la.
However, it was of no consequence, for the view from our
pass was grand, and below us lay a lake not marked on
Nain Sing&rsquo;s map. The valley descending from the pass is
so deeply eroded that we had to keep for some distance to
the heights on the right side. Islam Ahun led my tall
dapple-grey, which was weak and sickly; he took only a
few steps at a time, but he could still graze. We had made
a long march, and the camp could not be far distant, so he
would perhaps reach it. I therefore only stroked him as I
passed, while he held his nose to the ground and plucked
up the grass. But when I left him to his fate and rode
on, he raised his head, sighed heavily, and gazed after me.
I was deeply grieved afterwards that I did not remain with
him. He had carried me faithfully on the long dreary
journey from our departure from Leh until his back became
one great sore; then he was not worked till his back
was healed. Afterwards he was degraded to a pack-horse,
but when our caravan was reinforced with yaks, he was
exempted from work of any kind. Latterly we had had
abundance of barley for the animals, but he had shown no
signs of recovery. This day, however, he had managed to
climb the pass, and would surely be able to get over the
short remaining distance. But Islam Ahun came into
camp alone. The horse had stumbled on a very steep
descent, rolled over several times in the débris, and then
remained lying. Islam, who had received strict orders to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
be careful of the dapple-grey, stood and waited, but the
horse did not move again, and died where he was. Why
did I not understand him when he so plainly said a last
good-bye? I was much grieved at it, and for a long time
could not forget the troubled expression of his eyes as he
saw me ride away. The remembrance haunted me when
it grew dark at night and the winter storm howled in cold
dreary Tibet.</p>

<p>Down below in the valley basin lay the Dumbok-tso
asleep under its ice mantle, out of which rose a small
rocky ridge, the Tso-ri or &ldquo;Lake Mountain.&rdquo; Up above
the heights were still bathed in sunshine. The Dumbok-tso
was the most important discovery of the day. The
watch-fires burned in front of the tents and threw a yellow
light on the surroundings.</p>

<p>Then the day&rsquo;s notes were filled in, and Robert, as
usual, labelled the rock specimens we had collected.
&ldquo;Dinner is ready,&rdquo; says Tsering, as he brings in fresh
fuel, and the <i>shislik</i> and sour milk are served and placed
on the ground before my bed. Then I am left alone with
a thousand memories of Swedish Christmas feasts, and the
words: &ldquo;Christmas is now under every roof,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frozen
is the limpid lake, it waits for the winds of spring,&rdquo; from
the poet Topelius&rsquo; Christmas song, rings in my ears. The
Christian community in our camp consisted only of Robert
and myself, but we determined to celebrate the Christmas
festival so that the heathen also might have their share in
the enjoyment. For some time we had kept all the candle
ends, and now had forty-one pieces of various lengths. We
set up a box in the middle of my tent, and arranged the
candles on it so that the largest stood in the middle, and
the others became smaller and smaller towards the corners.
That was our Christmas-tree. When all the candles were
lighted we threw back the flaps of the front of the tent,
and the Ladakis, who meanwhile had assembled outside,
gave vent to a murmur of astonishment. They sang
softly in rising and falling tones. I forgot for a time the
solemnity of the moment, and gazing into the flickering
flames of the candles let the minutes of the holy night glide
slowly by. The sentimental air was now and then interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
by a thundering <i>khavash</i> and <i>khabbaleh</i> in which all
joined, howling like jackals. The flutes performed the
accompaniment, and a saucepan served as a drum. Lamaist
hymns at a Christmas festival under the constellation of
Orion! Dimly illuminated from the tent, and flooded
by the silvery light of the moon, my men presented a
weird appearance as they turned themselves round in
their native dance, keeping time to the noise of the saucepan.
The Tibetans of the neighbouring tents perhaps
thought that we had all gone mad, or perhaps that we were
executing an incantation dance, and had lighted sacrificial
lamps to propitiate our gods. What the wild asses, grazing
on the lake shore, thought of it, no one can tell.</p>

<p>Our young guide, who had been placed in the middle of
the tent door, caused us much amusement. He stared,
now at the lights, now at me, without uttering a sound, sat
like a cat on the watch with its fore-paws on the ground,
and did nothing but gaze. He would have wonderful
stories to tell his fellow-tribesmen, which would certainly
lose none of their effect by the embellishments added by
himself and amplified in the course of repetition. Perhaps
the memory of our visit still survives in the country, in a
legend of singular fire-worshippers who danced and
bellowed round an altar adorned with forty-one burning
candles. When the youth was asked how he liked the
illumination, he made no answer. We laughed till our
sides ached, but that did not disturb him; he continued to
glare with eyes full of astonishment. When he had somewhat
recovered his senses next morning, he told Tundup
Sonam in confidence that he had had many experiences,
but that he had never met with anything so extraordinary
as the evening&rsquo;s entertainment. He would not sleep with
us that night, but went off to the tents of his people, and
on the first holiday he begged permission to return home.</p>

<p>The lower the candles burned down, the brighter the
stars of Orion shone into the opening of the tent. The
corner lights had long gone out, and only a couple in the
middle continued to flicker. Then I distributed a small
sum of money among the men, beginning with Robert and
Muhamed Isa. That was the only Christmas present.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
After this the men retired to their fires, which had in the
meantime gone out. Two had to stay behind to explain
to me one of the songs in which the word Tashi-lunpo had
repeatedly occurred. It was more difficult than I expected
to translate the song. In the first place, the men did not
know it well themselves, and, secondly, they did not know
the meaning of some of the words it contained. Other
words they understood well enough, but they could not
translate them into Turki or Hindustani. First we wrote
out the hymn in Tibetan, then Robert translated it into
Hindustani, and I into Turki, and finally from the two
translations we concocted an English version which had no
sense or meaning. But by repeatedly taking the song to
pieces and analyzing it, we at last made out what the
subject was&mdash;it was a glorification of the monastery Tashi-lunpo,
which was the goal of our hopes. The learned who
happen to be acquainted with ancient Tibetan hymns will
be very much amused if they take the trouble to read the
following translation. It certainly has the merit of forming
a record in poetic license.</p>

<p>So ended our Christmas Eve in the wilderness, and
while the glow of the Christmas fire sank down in the
ashes I read the old Bible passages relating to this day,
put out my light, and dreamed of Christmas festivals in
the north, and of Tashi-lunpo down in the south behind the
mountains, the goal towards which we had been struggling
amid suffering and privation all through the cold winter,
and which was still far off and perhaps even beyond our
reach.</p>

<p class="center chap2">TEN DAYS ON THE ICE OF NGANGTSE-TSO</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">From</span> the Christmas camp we travelled southwards over
two passes, of which the second, called Laen-la, forms a
watershed between the Dubok-tso and the Ngangtse-tso.
The great lake itself we do not see yet, but a distant bluish
background of mountain chain which rises from the southern
shore of the lake. A yak was lost; he was not exhausted,
but his fore-hoof had split so that he had become lame.
When once he had laid himself down no power on earth
could induce him to get up again; tugging at the rope,
which was passed through his nasal cartilage, availed
nothing. We therefore left him behind, and gave him to
the natives nearest to our camp. Several yaks and the
surviving veterans from Leh were in need of a thorough
rest, so we decided to remain a fortnight at the great lake.
It was certainly risky to linger so long at one place in
Naktsang, where I had met with such determined
opposition in the year 1901, for we should give the authorities
time to make their preparations. But we must
rest; we had no choice.</p>

<p>After a night temperature of &minus;24.20° we marched down
the longitudinal valley to a point immediately above the
place where the valley emerges into the lake-plain, and
bivouacked near a group of tents containing six households.
The whole country is corroded with mouse holes, and
sometimes they lie in stages one above another. If one
reckoned in the central parts of Tibet only one field-mouse
to the square yard, the resulting total would be marvellous.
At camp No. 97, for instance, it was impossible to lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
down my bed without covering several holes, and I was
awaked in the morning by the mice, which were making
a noise and squeaking beneath my bed, and wondering
why they could not get out of their house door.</p>

<p>The nomads of the district were friendly disposed, and
sold us sheep, butter, and milk. They said that the high
road to Shigatse skirted the east side of the lake; another
to the west of the Ngangtse-tso was much longer and more
difficult. The highway to Lhasa runs eastwards through
Shanza-dzong. Thus far it had been followed by Nain
Sing, whose route we crossed here; for from the Marku-tso,
a small lagoon on the north shore, the road he took
passes to the west-north-west. Many nomad communities
winter on the extensive plains of the lake shore, especially
on the south side. The nomads never travel over the lake,
the most direct and quickest way, for they mistrust the ice,
and our last guide would on no account accompany us
over the lake, but warned us of the thin ice. His statements
seemed to me more probable when he said that
the lake was salt, that the water was not fit for drinking,
and that there were neither fish nor plants in it.</p>

<p>The long period of rest must be utilized somehow. It
had, moreover, been one of the aims proposed in the
original scheme of my journey, to investigate the country
round the central lakes discovered in 1874 by Nain Sing,
and to execute soundings in several of them. If the
ice held firm we could go over the lake, and sound
through holes. Two men were therefore sent out to
examine the ice: 100 paces from the bank the ice was
11 inches thick, at 200 paces 10¼ inches, and even at 300
paces 10 inches; so I determined to commence at the
nearest point to our headquarters.</p>

<p>Robert and Muhamed Isa were to remain behind to
watch over our animals and attend to them. It might,
indeed, be risky to split up our caravan just at this time,
but I could not remain idle for a whole fortnight. There
was everything we needed at the headquarters&mdash;nomads,
pasturage, water, and fuel; the place seemed to be of some
importance, for a round <i>mani</i> stood in the valley, and
Robert found on a ridge a <i>samkang</i>, a hermit&rsquo;s cave, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
a small stone wall in front of it. There the lama Togldan
was wont to dwell in summer, earning his bread from the
neighbouring nomads by murmuring formulæ to conjure
evil spirits, and offering up prayers for the prosperity of
their flocks. We had an hour and a half&rsquo;s journey to the
northern shore, and there innumerable camping-places
indicate summer visits of nomads. There the tents are
situated among excellent pasture lands, exposed to the
noonday sun, with the great lake, often agitated by
boisterous storms, in front of them.</p>

<p>We got ready provisions for ten days for myself and
half a dozen Ladakis. Two live sheep were taken. The
men were to take Robert&rsquo;s small tent, but I intended to
sleep under a half of the boat, which was to be pushed
over the ice as a sledge, laden with all the baggage, bed,
furs, and instruments. The boat would also be a source
of safety should we at any time venture on to too thin ice.
The white puppy was to go with us to keep me company.
During my absence Robert occupied my tent, where the
barograph and the thermograph ticked on my boxes.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of December 29 I rode down to the
Ngangtse-tso, where camp No. 98 was pitched on a lagoon
under the shelter of a shore embankment. Towards the
east-south-east the country is open as far as the sight can
carry; the eastern shore of the lake is scarcely perceptible,
the western not at all; in the south-west snow mountains
rise up, which, I said to myself, must be Nain Sing&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Targot Lha Snowy Peaks.&rdquo; Rabsang was my valet,
Bulu my cook; they arranged my improvised hut, and the
building material consisted of half of the boat, the stand
of my photographic camera, and a frieze rug. For dinner
I was given leg of mutton, sour milk, bread, orange marmalade,
and tea; and then I smoked an Indian cheroot and
gazed at the lake, which was to be thoroughly investigated
during the succeeding days.</p>

<p>The 30th of December, a Sunday, began brightly with
45.2 degrees of frost. Puppy had kept my feet warm. It
was rather tight work washing and dressing in my den, but
when at last I was ready, I could enjoy the fire, the sight
of the sun and of the great lake. The baggage was quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
packed, and the boat was dragged on to the ice and kept in
equilibrium by two runners, while six men pushed it forward.
But the ice gave us much trouble. The salt separated out
on freezing had collected on the surface like dry potato
flour, sometimes forming continuous sheets, sometimes
swept up into banks, ridges, and drifts, in which the
runners and keel stuck fast. However, in spite of it, we
worked our way on in a direction 9° east of south,
where I had selected a small dark cliff on the south shore
as a landmark. The first hole was cut out; the ice was 8½
inches thick, and the depth of the lake, reckoned from the
edge of the ice, only 13 feet.</p>

<p>After we had wandered on for some time we held a
council; I saw that we could not go on as we were. We
took off the runners and put together three simple sledges,
on each of which a third of the baggage was tied. And in
this way we struggled on a short distance farther, while I
went on foot. At the next hole the depth was 18.7 feet;
probably we were on one of those extraordinarily shallow
salt lakes, such as I had often met with in north-eastern
Tibet. Again we held a consultation; our sledges made
such slow progress that we should never get over the
lake at all, far less traverse it several times. When two
of the baggage sledges, which had lingered far behind,
came up, I sent a message to Robert to send me more
men and all the pieces of old boxes that were in the
caravan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we took off the two zinc runners, which
were screwed into the gunwale and into which the mast
thwart was fitted. They were then fastened as sledge
cheeks to two benches bound together; to the sides of
this singular vehicle two long poles were attached, meeting
at an angle, through which the towing-rope was slung. A
Caucasian <i>burkha</i>, which I had bought at Trebizond, was
laid in several folds on the benches. For the sounding
apparatus, the field-glass and other articles, we stretched a
hammock between the poles. When the structure was
complete it astonished us; for we had only to give this
newly devised sledge a push and off it ran a good way by
itself. Now the boat was contemptuously discarded, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
when Rabsang with the towing-rope over his shoulder
hurried off southwards over the ice unaided, the boat soon
diminished to a black speck and disappeared. The others
had orders to follow the track of the runners at their leisure;
they would soon get help when the other men came
(Illustrations 91, 92, 93).</p>

<p>Wrapped in my large sheepskin I sat cross-legged on
the sledge, which glided merrily over the ice by the hour
together, while Rabsang had no need to over-exert himself.
The sledge cut through the salt ridges as though they were
nothing, and bumped with a pleasant rumbling noise over
the places where the ice was lumpy; it jumped over cracks
and fissures, where the edges of the ice shone green, and
clear as glass, and on smooth patches shot noiselessly
forward, so that its point reached Rabsang&rsquo;s heels if he
did not jump on one side just when the line became
slack.</p>

<p>It was really not dangerous on the ice, which was
nowhere less than 7 inches thick. So the Tibetans&rsquo; dread
of drowning was exaggerated. But they have always
the greatest respect for the spirits inhabiting the lakes,
and would rather go all round a lake than cross it,
mistrusting the winter repose of the raging storm-beaten
waves.</p>

<p>Many singular effects of congelation may be observed,
which change their forms in various parts. Sometimes
they are innumerable vertical figures in perfectly clear
dark ice; seen from the side they have the form of oak
leaves, but looked at from above they resemble stars with
four arms thin as paper. At other places you find blocks
of white porous ice embedded in clear ice, the result of a
storm which has broken up the first ice-sheet of early
winter, whereafter the blocks are enclosed in new ice on
the final freezing over. Water is squeezed out through
long narrow cracks, and is congealed into screens sometimes
a yard in height, forming fantastic sheets and domes, and
edges and points often as sharp as a knife. Rabsang has
only to give them a kick to clear a passage for the sledge,
but these thin ice-fences are very misleading, and render it
difficult to estimate distances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span></p>

<p>We sounded in eight holes, and the greatest depth was
only 32 feet. The bottom consists of dark clay mud. It
took a good quarter of an hour to cut out a hole in the ice
with axes and crowbars. As soon as the last blow drove
through the bottom of the ice, clear, cold, dark green water
welled up and filled the cavity, and then the sounding
weight was let down by its rope.</p>

<p>The first line of soundings had occupied far too long a
time, chiefly owing to the interruptions and repeated rearrangement
of the baggage at starting, and we were still
far from the nearest shore when the sun set in clouds of
red and gold. But the full moon shone in the heavens,
the rocky promontory was sharp and clearly perceptible,
and we made all haste we could. The ice was uncomfortably
lumpy, so that I had to traverse long stretches on foot.
Cold, white, and desolate the ice mantle of the lake
extended on all sides; all was silent and quiet, only the
crunching sound of our own footsteps could be heard.
If nomads had pitched their tents on the shore we were
approaching they would be much perplexed by the black
specks moving out on the lake. But no fire illumined the
night and no wolves howled. In the darkness we could,
of course, gain no notion of how much further we had to
go. At the last hole the promontory had not appeared
much larger. And so we marched onwards until Rabsang
suddenly came to a halt with the information that we were
only a few hundred paces from dry land.</p>

<p>There we left the sledge and advanced to the outlying
mountains, where several fallen blocks of stone lay at the
foot. Under one of them we sat down to wait. Then
Rabsang collected as much fuel as he could in the dark.
We must light a signal fire to guide the others. At length
they tramped up, Tashi, Ishe, Bulu, and Islam Ahun, all
heavily laden, for they had preferred to leave the sledges
behind and carry the baggage. Two hours later some dark
points were noticed out on the ice; it was the reinforcement,
and now I had ten men with me. They had seen
from the lake fires at four places; we were therefore
surrounded by nomads on all sides, but we had no need of
them, so we did not trouble ourselves about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span></p>

<p>Profiting by experience, we made the most practical
arrangements possible for our next day&rsquo;s wanderings.
Islam Ahun was to return to headquarters, collecting all
the things we had dropped on our way, and was to see that
the boat was fetched. Rabsang and Tashi drew my sledge,
the others carried the baggage. At first they followed a
road along the shore before taking to the ice and making
for the goal for the day, in the north-west. We keep them
in sight all day. They march in Indian file, trotting, swaying,
and singing, and sometimes sitting down for a rest.
Then they use the firmly tied bundles as back-rests. But
they cannot get up again without help; it is very easy for
six of them, but the seventh, that is, the one who has to get
up first, finds it more difficult. He rolls over on to his
stomach, wriggles up with the help of a stick, and when he
has at length accomplished the feat, he helps the others to
get on their feet.</p>

<p>The ice was excellent, far better than on the first
traverse. Also the salt was less abundant, owing to the
westerly storms which sweep it eastwards. For long
distances the ice lay pure and smooth in front of us, and
had a dark green colour. I did not know what to make of
it when we tramped over the dark patches. Were there
warm springs at the bottom which prevented the lake
from freezing over in parts? But we soon became accustomed
to the sight, the ice was firm and at least 6½ inches
thick, while the greatest depth amounted to 31¾ feet. I
sat like a statue of Buddha cross-legged on my toy sledge,
smoked, took observations, made notes, and rejoiced that I
could keep New Year&rsquo;s Eve on the ice of Ngangtse-tso.
About mid-day a south-westerly wind arose, and I had to
ride backwards so as not to get frozen. A lead running
north and south puzzled us greatly. It was 5 feet broad,
and ran in either direction as far as the eye could reach;
open water lapped between the margins of ice. Probably
it had come into existence during a storm, when the whole
ice-sheet was slightly disturbed towards the east, and had
left behind it a yawning channel. After a long search we
found a place where fresh ice was being formed below.
Using the sledge as a bridge we crossed over dry-footed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
How the others got over the difficulty I do not know, but
they were not afraid of wetting their feet.</p>

<p>We went ashore rather early, at a place where 19
horses were grazing on the wide plain and a youth was
watching 500 sheep. He scampered off in a hurry
when he saw us coming, and I was not surprised that
he was afraid when he saw ten great fellows stealing
like ghosts over a lake that had never been trodden by
human foot. The Ladakis sat round a large fire, sang, and
blew their flutes, and the moonlight poured down a cold,
peaceful flood of light over the unknown strand where a
party of wandering strangers were passing a single night of
their lives. It was the last night of the year 1906, and the
camp was our hundredth.</p>

<p>A splendid New Year&rsquo;s morning in 1907! With joyful
hopes for the new year and its work I began the third
line of soundings in a direction south, 19° E., towards
a dark spur lying between two valleys where ice-clumps
glistened in the sun. The spur seemed to fall steeply to
the lake and the distance seemed tremendous, but it was
an illusion: the low plain extending from the foot of the
mountains to the lake could not be seen from the ice. We
had to cross the fissure of the day before, but it had frozen
over in the night. But water stood in many other fissures
and spurted up as we passed over. This day our porters
kept up with us, and their songs resounded far and wide
over the ice-fields. At every new hole they settled down
and awaited the result of the sounding with genuine
interest. Singular men, always cheerful and contented,
never down-hearted and complaining, taking everything as
it comes, and calm and composed in all kinds of wind and
weather.</p>

<p>Puppy has had enough of running over the ice, suffers
from cold feet, jumps on the sledge as soon as it comes to
a halt, but has a decided objection to riding.</p>

<p>A conical summit to the south of camp No. 99 dominates
the whole lake like a lighthouse. Nain Sing, who touched
the north shore of the Ngangtse-tso, has drawn the outline
of the lake on the whole correctly, but has made the south-western
part too broad. There also the sheet of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
narrows down to a point, and the whole has the form of a
half-moon. The mountains, which the Pundit has inserted
in his map on the south side of the lake, are very erroneously
portrayed, and no wonder&mdash;for he saw them only from a
great distance, and could not possibly, in these circumstances,
obtain any proper notion of their configuration.
It is just as hard to form an idea of a lake by viewing it
from the shore; this is possible only from a pass or a
crest.</p>

<p>We wondered whether we could reach the southern
shore before twilight, for the distance seemed still enormous.
About noon the wind began to blow strongly, whirled up
white clouds of dry salt, swept them along the ice, and
obscured our view. Sitting on the sledge I was exposed
to its full onslaught, and had to be careful not to open my
mouth. Here and there the ice rose in undulations, as
though it had been formed in a high sea; the ice-waves
also have a steep slope towards east-north-east, the way of
the wind. In the troughs between them the salt-dust
driven by the wind collects, and lends to the ice-field a
curious appearance like watered silk. All the eastern half
of the lake is concealed by the rocky promontories near
which our camp, No. 99, is pitched. We penetrate more
deeply into the southern bay. Yaks graze on the slopes,
and towards evening are driven down by a man. To the
south also we catch sight of tents, yaks, and groups of
kiangs. From our low point of view they seem to be
moving in the midst of the lake; the acuteness of the
angle of elevation deceives us. At the last sounding-hole
the axe and crow-bar bored deeper and deeper into the ice
without breaking through. Not till a depth of 17¼ inches
was reached did the water burst violently up, full of the
usual small red crustaceæ&mdash;the salinity of the lake cannot
therefore be very great. Somewhat further the ice was
found to lie directly on the clayey bottom without a layer
of water beneath it. Then we came to the sterile shore,
and were glad that we were this day independent of
vegetation. We found fuel and obtained water by melting
lumps of ice. The greatest depth on this line was 30.8
feet, or a little less than on the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span></p>

<p>We had another boisterous storm towards evening.
The lake ice, only a couple of yards distant, vanished
completely from sight, and the dung-gatherers suddenly
emerged from the mist when they were only a few steps
from the fire. I could not understand how they found
their way in such a thick atmosphere. They erected a
shelter from the wind with the sledge and three sacks of
fuel, and sat behind it by their fire, the flickering flames
almost singeing their faces. The group was exceedingly
picturesque in the dark night and the struggling moon-beams.
And how it blew! I could scarcely keep my
feet when I read the thermometer, and my cap flew in all
directions. In the night the men slept huddled up together
in the shelter of the tent.</p>

<p>The temperature on January 2 was &minus;8°. To-day the
fourth line had to be executed; it was short, it is true&mdash;barely
five hours, but trying. We had to march south-westwards,
straight in the teeth of the wind. Moreover, the
ice proved rough and heavy, doubtless in consequence of
the slight depth of the lake. The maximum depth was
10.6 feet. In my diary, this day is described as one of the
worst, if not absolutely the worst, day of the whole journey.
But we always think that what is present is the worst,
forgetting the horrors of the past. The storm drove the
salt before it in thick clouds, which scoured the ice with a
swishing sound and dashed into my face. When I ordered
my two &ldquo;towing horses&rdquo; to keep the direction, a quantity
of salt flew into my mouth, and I had the greater difficulty
in getting rid of the disagreeable taste that the powder also
made its way into my nose. My eyes became red, watered,
and ached. My hands, from constant contact with the
sounding-line for several days, were encrusted with salt,
and the skin cracked so deeply that the blood ran. Sometimes
my hands turned blue, were stiff, and lost all feeling,
so that it was only with the greatest difficulty that I
managed, holding the pen in the fist like a chisel, to jot
down the results of the soundings, the times, and distances;
other notes were not to be thought of. Rabsang and
Tashi at all events kept themselves warm, for they had to
put forth all their strength to drag the sledge against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
storm. Where the ice was smooth they could not get firm
foothold, slipped and fell; once Tashi was thrown into my
lap, capsized by the gale. Often the wind was so strong
that sledge, and team were driven backwards, and the men
could only stop themselves by sitting down and planting
their feet against a ridge of salt. I became so benumbed
and helpless that I could not rise, and had to remain sitting
while the holes were hacked out. But at one hole, which
was broken in a field of ice as smooth as a mirror, the
wind seized the sledge and myself and carried us in a dizzy
race over the lake like an ice-yacht. I tried to put on the
drag with my feet, but I had no power in them, and my
boots of soft felt glided lightly and jauntily over the ice
mirror without reducing the speed in the least. The
runners were too short, and the sledge revolved in a circle,
but still it moved onwards, and if the ice had been all
smooth, the storm would have blown me back in a few
minutes all across the lake to camp No. 98. Then my
vehicle fortunately tilted over in a fissure, I was thrown
out, shot a little way farther over the ice, and landed on a
salt ridge. Rabsang hurried sliding after me, picked up
me and the sledge, and drew me back to the hole
unharmed (Illustration 94).</p>

<p>Our appearance was enough to frighten one another.
We looked like swollen disinterred corpses, dried in the
sun and daubed with white oil paint. Faces, hands, and
clothes were white with salt. I could not wear my sheepskin
again; it was stiff, had given way at the seams, and
had to be thrown away with other clothes.</p>

<p>We had not yet covered half the distance. The men
exerted themselves as though they had to struggle through
water 3 feet deep. Oftentimes I could not see through
the clouds of salt, and nothing was visible of the ice
beneath the sledge; it seemed as though we stood still
while a foaming white flood poured down on us ready to
swallow us up. I wondered whether we should ever reach
the shore alive. There was very little life in me when we
at length landed. The sledge was anchored to prevent the
storm carrying it away, and then we climbed five terrace
banks, one after another, to seek shelter behind the wall of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
a sheepfold erected on the sixth. Fortunately we found
dry yak dung there in great abundance, and soon had a
roaring fire, at which I had to sit a good hour before my limbs
became at all supple again.</p>

<p>From camp No. 102 to the southern extremity of the
lake the distance measured 3260 paces. There large herds
were feeding, and six tents were set up at the mouth of the
valley. About five o&rsquo;clock the storm ceased as suddenly
as it had sprung up, and it became strangely calm. When
I took the meteorological observations at nine o&rsquo;clock all
my men were lying in a row, with their heads against the
wall, their foreheads on the ground, and their legs drawn
up, and as close to one another as sardines in a tin. They
slept well; that I could tell from the tunes their nasal
organs emitted.</p>

<p>There were shells of freshwater molluscs on the strand,
and a quantity of goose feathers in a bank formed of decaying
algæ. At present the water of the lake is not fit to drink,
but the Ngangtse-tso was a freshwater lake formerly, that
is, when it still discharged into one of its neighbours.</p>

<p>Wearied by our exertions on the previous day we slept
till late, and then started off in a north-easterly direction
towards the red porphyry mountains which jut out into the
lake to the west of camp No. 99. We had no storm, but a
brisk wind, and when it blew at our backs we glided like
oil over the ice. I had a pole to steer with.</p>

<p>Beyond the promontory we encamped in a deep hollow
to obtain shelter from the wind. A shepherd was feeding
his sheep on a slope and tried to make his escape, but
Rabsang overtook him. He thought we were robbers.
He had nothing to sell, for he was in the service of
another man. But Rabsang requested him to bring his
master to us. Meanwhile the others had arrived, except
Ishe, who had fallen ill, and was left lying in the middle of
the lake. Two of his comrades fetched him in the evening.
All were tired out, and begged that they might make a
short march on January 4, and that suited us well, for the
shepherd&rsquo;s master came and sold us a sheep, butter, sour
milk, and a bag of tobacco. It was high time, for the provisions
were almost consumed. The tobacco was quite a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
godsend to the men, for latterly they had been reduced to
smoking yak dung! The old man gave much interesting
information about the Ngangtse-tso, and told us that there
were then fifty to sixty tents pitched in the valleys of the
southern shore. So far all was well, but the day was not
yet ended.</p>

<p class="center chap2">DRIVEN BACK</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">A dismal</span>, inauspicious day was January 4, 1907. Towards
noon Islam Ahun appeared, half dead with weariness.
He had left headquarters on the morning of the 2nd, and
searched up and down the lake for us; had been on the west
and on the south shore; and at last, following the most
recent track of the sledge, had found us in our dell.
He brought me a letter from Robert:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Yesterday, on January 1st, six armed men came to the camp,
made a few inquiries, and went off again. To-day, the 2nd, they
returned with some other men, and said the Governor of Naktsang
had ordered them not to allow us to proceed further, because we
had no passport from the Devashung, and that we must remain
where we are. They wanted an answer from Master, in order to
report to the Governor, who would communicate immediately with
Lhasa. They are waiting impatiently for a reply, so I am sending
off this letter.</p>
</div>

<p>After Islam Ahun had rested and eaten, he had to take
back a letter to Robert at camp No. 97. Robert was to
inform the ambassadors that I would not give an answer
until I had seen them in person; if they were so anxious
to hear it, they might come on the afternoon of the 5th to
the northern shore at a distance of three miles from camp
No. 98. If they did not, they must be answerable for the
consequences. Muhamed Isa must come with them as
interpreter.</p>

<p>Now matters were coming to a head. This time it was
not a false alarm. Tidings of our journey had been sent to
Lhasa, and we were in the hands of the Governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
Naktsang. I had put off the decisive moment in order to
get time for at least one more line of soundings. If I
could advance no farther in Naktsang, at any rate I would
complete my investigation of the Ngangtse-tso. Afterwards
the great retreat might commence. The intense
excitement in which we had lived during the past months
had now reached its culmination, and the Ngangtse-tso was
to be the turning-point of our journey. I heard distinctly
the creaking and grinding of the hinges as the great gates
of the land of holy books, the forbidden land in the south,
were slammed in my face.</p>

<p>At length we set off to camp No. 104, which was
situated on the southern shore to the east of camp No. 99.</p>

<p>January 5. Every blade and stalk was covered with
rime in the early morning when we marched over the ice
in a direction north, 19° E. The day was fine and calm,
the air pleasant, almost warm. Was the spring coming?
Did spring set in so early in these more southern regions?
It had seemed so far off that we had not thought of
looking forward to its mild air while the long winter of
Chang-tang still lingered in our limbs. We needed more
warmth to thaw properly. The ice cracked and groaned
wildly in the night, but it was not on that account that I slept
badly.</p>

<p>Here the ice-fields form long waves; banks of water
pressed up and then frozen, brittle as glass, came in sight
every minute. The greatest depth, 32.9 feet, occurred
when we were 6.6 miles from the shore, and was the
deepest we sounded in the Ngangtse-tso. The lake is,
then, deeper in the east; the west wind silts up its western
half with sand and dust.</p>

<p>Half way across we saw a small dark speck on the ice
in the direction of the Laen valley. It was the Hajji with
a letter. The envoys had received fresh orders from the
Governor of Naktsang. In four days he would appear in
his own exalted person, and meanwhile his representatives
were to watch us closely. Consequently they remained
with the caravan, but they had allowed Robert and Muhamed
Isa to transfer our headquarters to a place south-east
of camp No. 97, where the pasturage was better.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
We had therefore freedom for a couple of days longer.
The Governor of Naktsang! It was he who in 1901
had made me halt at the south side of the Zilling-tso. I
could expect no mercy from him. On the contrary, I had
on the former occasion given him so much trouble and
annoyance that he would be furious at my return to his
province.</p>

<p>On January 6 Ishe was so ill that the Hajji was
obliged to take him home. Now we crossed the lake
again in a direction north, 49° E. We had just arrived
at our second sounding-hole when three men, who had
followed our track, came in sight behind us. They made
signs that we should stop, so fresh news must have arrived.
We were able to cut out our hole and take a sounding
before they came running up to us. They were Muhamed
Isa with two other of my men, perspiring and breathless,
and I invited them to make themselves comfortable on
our lawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the news?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sahib, twenty-five Tibetans have pitched their tents
round about ours. We wished this morning to move our
headquarters to the shore, in order to be nearer to you.
All the animals were laden, and we were about to set out,
when the men came out of their tents and forced us to
unload the animals again, and ordered us to stay where we
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything more of the Governor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is to be here in three days. Mounted messengers
are coming and going daily, often several in one day, and
they seem to ride fast. They are in constant communication
with the Governor and send him reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they say to my remaining away so long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are exceedingly astonished at it, and repeatedly
ask us what the Sahib is doing out on the ice. They have
had spies on the shore, and believe that the Sahib is
dredging up gold through the holes from the lake bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they civil to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but determined and immovable. They say that
the Governor himself will decide our fate. Their number
has been greatly increased during the latter days, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
have provisions brought to them, and they expect further
reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is their intention, do you think, Muhamed Isa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the outlook is not bright. They certainly intend
to render our further progress impossible, and to force us
to go northwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to thank for this that ill-omened fellow on
the Bogtsang-tsangpo, who has despatched an express
messenger to Naktsang. If we come to a deadlock here,
they must provide us with a new caravan, and we will
travel to Pekin. There I will procure permission from the
Chinese Government to travel through Tibet. How is
the caravan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well. A mule died the day before yesterday,
and my black saddle-horse yesterday. Eight horses and a
mule are left. The yaks are in splendid condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have plenty of time to rest at this lake, for
if we have to negotiate with Lhasa, it will be a couple of
months before the question is settled. Now, go back and
remember me to the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went on with our sounding and found a maximum
depth of 27.4 feet. On the shore old banks were plainly
perceptible; they have here been exposed to the breakers
of the western storms. The highest might be about 50
feet high. There paced a solitary wolf, farther back 25
kiangs were grazing; they looked at us inquisitively for a
long time, and then darted away as lightly and swiftly as
the wind. We saw no sign of our porters, and on the shore,
where we walked along the highest bank, we did not find
a track. Why did they not signal by lighting a fire? At
last we caught sight of them far off in a northerly direction.
They were tired and lay down to sleep as soon as they
reached land. I did not scold them, but Rabsang seized
the first he could get hold of by the hair, and then gave them
all a thrashing in turn, which, however, did not prevent
them singing as merrily as usual in the evening.</p>

<p>Now my work on the Ngangtse-tso was finished, after
marches over the ice aggregating 66 miles.</p>

<p>On January 7 the porters with all our belongings, except
my tent, set off for headquarters. I waited for my riding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
horse, did not allow my mind to be disturbed, and was in
no hurry to give myself up to the Tibetan militia&mdash;those
horrid black riders who had so often interfered with my
plans. No news came from Shigatse, no post from India.
I had ordered it to arrive at the Dangra-yum-tso on the
25th of November, and now it was January 7. Had
Ganpat Sing lost the letters, or had they never reached
Leh? Was it, perhaps, impossible, for political reasons, to
send me my letters from India?</p>

<p>I had to wait a long time. It was not till one o&rsquo;clock
that a man appeared with my horse, and at the same time
a caravan of 50 yaks appeared on the inner terrace embankment,
driven by Tibetans. We supposed that it was
the Governor&rsquo;s baggage train, but the Tibetans said that
they were natives of Laen, and had been attending the
market in Naktsang.</p>

<p>We were three hours from the camp. Seven wild
asses trotted in front of us for an hour; the wind was
strong against us. Clouds of sand and dust swept along
the bank, the icy surface became invisible, and the wild
asses disappeared like ghosts in the mist. The light was
curious and confusing, the ascent became steeper, and
fresh hills continually appeared out of the dense air, which
was like muddy water. Often a small troop of Goa gazelles
sprang lightly past. We did not see camp No. 107 until
we were close upon it.</p>

<p>A deep erosion channel running towards the lake. On
its right flank are our four tents, looking eastwards.
Muhamed Isa stands at his fire, his hands in his pockets,
his pipe in his mouth (Illustration 66). All the others
come out. The Tibetans peer out of their tents like field-mice
out of their holes. Robert reports: &ldquo;All quiet on the
Shipka pass.&rdquo; The day before our horses, chased by
wolves, had stampeded and had taken the Tibetan horses
with them, but they were all found again in scattered
groups along the shore.</p>

<p>I entered Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tent; when I was seated the
principal Tibetans were summoned. They presented
themselves immediately, bowed low, and thrust out their
tongues as far as possible; this time this original mode of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
salutation seemed to me a mockery. A man with a red turban,
dark-blue fur coat, and a sabre in his belt, had
been in 1901 in Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s camp on the eastern
shore of the Chargut-tso, when we encamped together,
and he reminded me of that time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Hlaje Tsering still ruler of Naktsang?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is he who is coming the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he bringing with him as large a following as last
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he perceived then that the troops of mounted men
did not frighten you, and he trusts that you will be amenable
to his wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>January 8 was spent in repacking the baggage, and on
the 9th the Tibetans set up another tent, intended, they
said, for the Governor&rsquo;s kitchen. At dusk two riders
arrived, who announced that the Governor begged to be
excused for not arriving at the stated time. He was an old
man, had had the storm against him on the way, and
could only travel slowly, but he would certainly be here on
the evening of the 12th.</p>

<p>Then I sent for the chiefs of the Tibetans, and told
them that they would not be admitted to my presence again
if they did not speak the truth this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bombo Chimbo,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;if the Governor is
not here in three days you may cut off our heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not necessary; it will suffice if you bind yourselves
in writing to pay me a fine of ten horses if the
Governor is not here in three days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will give you twenty horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ten are enough.&rdquo; And now the contract was
drawn up and signed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any fresh information?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; the Governor has brought only his own twelve
servants. He knows that the Bombo Chimbo is come
back, for he received a letter from the Bogtsang-tsangpo,
saying that the same traveller who had been there five
years ago with a camel caravan was there again. Then
he sent an express to Lhasa, and waited ten days for an answer,
but at length decided to come himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our patience was put to the trial again, as though we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
had not had already occasion enough to exercise it. At
last, on the 11th, a small group of cavaliers appeared
against the hills, and soon after a blue-and-white tent
stood in the camp of the Tibetans&mdash;they had now seven
in all. Then followed a party of mounted men, one of
whom sat very much bent, wore a red <i>bashlik</i>, and was
carefully wrapped in furs. &ldquo;That is Hlaje Tsering,&rdquo; we
were told. His followers carried guns decked with red
pennants. They seemed very starved, quickly withdrew
into their tents, and we heard nothing more of them.</p>

<p>January 12. All too soon a messenger came to ask if
I would go to the Governor&rsquo;s tent, or whether he should
first pay me a visit. I sent an answer that I would let
him know when I could receive him. My poor storm-beaten
tent was made as fine as circumstances allowed;
there was no room for more than two guests, but frieze
rugs and cushions were laid down for them, and between
these seats and my bed a large brazier was placed, so that
the old man might get a good warm. My messenger was
just gone, when two horses were led up to the blue-and-white
tent, and the old man mounted one, a young lama the
other; the horses were led by the bridle, the other Tibetans
fell in on foot, and the procession moved off slowly to
our tents.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">95. <span class="sc">Hlaje Tsering and his Travelling Companion, a Lama, at my Tent on the Ngangtse-tso.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Hlaje Tsering, for it was really my old friend, came in
a parade costume of Chinese cut, with a Chinese cap,
decorated with two foxes&rsquo; tails and a white glass button,
and in boots trimmed with velvet and with thick white
soles. On his silken robe with wide hanging sleeves he
wore a short collar of otter skin, and in the lobe of the left
ear a large earring of pure gold studded with round turquoises.
When he appeared I went to meet and salute
him. We at once recognized each other, exchanged warm
greetings, nay, almost embraced, and remarked how
singular it was that we should meet here again in the
midst of the wilderness after five long years. Holding
his hand in mine, I conducted him to the modest seat of
honour, and invited the lama, his secretary, a son of the Yunduk
Tsering of 1901, to take a seat. I sat cross-legged
on my bed beside him, Robert and Muhamed Isa in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
tent door, while the rest of the space framed by the opening
was filled with a mosaic of Tibetan heads. Muhamed
Isa, the interpreter, wore a robe of ceremony presented to
him by Younghusband in Lhasa: it was made of thick,
cerise-coloured Tibetan woollen material, and was confined
round the waist by a coloured girdle; on his head he wore
a tall gold-embroidered turban from Peshawar. He put
us all in the shade with his finery (Illustrations 30, 95.)</p>

<p>After I had taken out a box of Egyptian cigarettes, and
Hlaje Tsering had for a time examined everything in the
tent, he said with a solemn, troubled manner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my capacity as Governor of Naktsang I cannot
allow you to proceed further, to Shigatse or in any other
direction within the boundaries of Naktsang. Soon after
the English expedition to Lhasa I received orders from
the Devashung to allow no European in future, as
formerly, to travel about in Naktsang. My instructions
are that if any European forces his way into Naktsang
it is the duty of my office to stop him and force him to
turn back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied: &ldquo;It is impossible that the conditions remain
the same as five years ago, when you held up my caravan
with your militia of 500 men. Since then the Indian
Government has concluded a treaty with the Devashung
in Lhasa, and now the two Governments are on most
friendly terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hedin Sahib, you will remember what took place
last time. You were then so kind as to turn back at my
request, but you do not know what befell me. All the
expenses of the levy raised against you I had to pay,
and the Devashung demanded from me 2000 rupees in
addition. I was ruined, while my colleague, Yunduk
Tsering, enriched himself by exploiting the people, and
now lives, a wealthy man, in Lhasa. We are old friends,
but I cannot expose myself to new vexations on your
account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, Hlaje Tsering, that we are old friends, but
you cannot expect me to undergo another journey through
Chang-tang on your behalf. I owned 130 animals when
I left Ladak five months ago. Now, as you can see yourself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
I have only 9. I will not be persuaded to return
by the same way, and by the treaty of Lhasa you have no
means of compelling a stranger by force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The treaty of Lhasa was concluded with England.
You are not an Englishman but a Swede-<i>Peling</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the more reason to show me hospitality.
England forced a war on you against your wishes; my
country has not done so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right; your people has never injured us.
But in my instructions no distinction is made between
different nations. I shall certainly not force you to
retrace your steps to Ladak by the long troublesome
route by which you came; I know that this is impossible
without a large strong caravan. It is of no consequence
to me whether you succeed in reaching Shigatse or not, but
you must not travel thither through my province. In
Naktsang there is only one road open to you, namely, the
one by which you came. I do not mind what road you
take afterwards, and if you can force your way to Shigatse
from the northern and western shores of the Dangra-yum-tso,
that is not my affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that the Tashi Lama was in India a year
ago, and how well he was received there. He expects me
in his capital, and no one else has the right to hinder me
on my journey to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naktsang is under the Devashung, not under the
Tashi Lama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dalai Lama took to flight when the English
troops drew near to Lhasa. The Tashi Lama is now,
therefore, Tibet&rsquo;s foremost Grand Lama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right; we do not understand the action of the
Dalai Lama, and do not approve of it. He should have
been the first to protect his country from its enemies. But
that has nothing to do with the question. I receive my
instructions solely and only from the Devashung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall not leave Naktsang until the Tashi Lama
has confirmed your statement that the way is closed. I
will, then, forward a letter to the representative of the
Indian Government in Gyangtse, Major O&rsquo;Connor, and if
he replies that the political situation forbids my travelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
further, I will leave Tibet. I will await his answer here,
at the Ngangtse-tso. And I have another reason for this
resolution. I am expecting letters from India, which are
to be forwarded through Major O&rsquo;Connor. You will
understand that I am not disposed to leave Naktsang
before the arrival of my letters, which will doubtless be
sent on by order of the Tashi Lama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very fine, but have you any proof that the
Tashi Lama will assume the responsibility of forwarding
your letters? You have no passport from the Devashung.
Have you one from the Tashi Lama? It is not my duty
to serve your pleasure. If I send your letter to Gyangtse
on my own responsibility I shall lose my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send two of my own Ladakis with the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the land is closed to them as much as to you.
And, besides, how long do you expect to have to wait here
for the answer? Several months?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; it is 165 English miles to Gyangtse, and the
journey will not take more than twenty days, even with
short marches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not leave this place till you have started northwards
and passed the frontier of Naktsang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will not start till I have received an answer to
my letter from Gyangtse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot possibly remain here long. You cannot
feed your men; there are no nomads here, and those who
dwell in the neighbourhood are poor as rats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw many tents on the southern shore and large
flocks. At the worst we can live by hunting; there is
plenty of game here. As I ask nothing but that you will
allow me to wait here for an answer, you might oblige me
so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you make a mistake. In my position neither
Shigatse nor Gyangtse has anything to do with me. When
the English had evacuated Tibet the Devashung sent a
proclamation round to every <i>dzong</i> (governor&rsquo;s residential
town) in Tibet that we had certainly been beaten, but that
we had lost none of our territory and were still masters
over it, so that the old regulations with regard to European
travellers were still in force. I will try to meet you as far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
as I can, and will now withdraw to my tent to take counsel
with my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time I held a council of war with Robert
and Muhamed Isa. It was perfectly evident that we could
not continue our journey southwards. On the other hand,
it seemed possible that, making a detour to the Dangra-yum-tso,
we might penetrate into the country on its west
side, which was governed, Hlaje Tsering said, from Saka-dzong.
Were we driven from there, we would direct our
course to Pekin. Why? I am certainly very optimistic,
but I had a conviction that I could befool the Chinese
Emperor as Marco Polo did, and obtain his permission to
travel about freely in Tibet, with some kind of special
mission as a pretext. Muhamed Isa thought it was an
enormous distance to Pekin, but Robert was enthusiastic
about the journey. We would only take our best men;
for the others I could procure permission to return to
Ladak through Gartok. We should have a hard journey
at first, but through Southern Mongolia we should fly on
Bactrian camels like wild deer over the steppe. I would
on no account return home vanquished. I tried to infect
the two others with my enthusiasm, and depicted our camel
ride as a fairy tale and a romance.</p>

<p>Now two of Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s men presented themselves,
bringing a dish of rice and a lump of butter as a present
from their master. The secretary lama sent an apron full
of rice. In return I sent Muhamed Isa with a whole piece
of <i>pashmina</i> cloth and a knife from Srinagar for the
Governor, and a similar knife and a turban bandage for
the secretary.</p>

<p>I returned the visit about three o&rsquo;clock, accompanied by
Robert and Muhamed Isa. Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s tent was
large and handsomely fitted up, and all his secretaries
and servants were sitting round the fire, which blazed up
towards the upper opening. At the sides lay sacks of rice
and <i>tsamba</i>, and several whole slaughtered sheep; everything
showed that the old man was prepared for a long
stay. Guns with rests and pennants, sabres and lances,
harness, bridles, saddles and saddle-cloths, lent a picturesque
and warlike aspect to this chieftain&rsquo;s tent. Along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
shorter side, opposite the entrance, thick cushions were
piled up, and covered with small Lhasa rugs, and round
cushions laid upon them served as supports for the back.
I was invited to take my seat there beside Hlaje Tsering;
a small red lacquered table was placed in front of us. On
our right stood an altar shrine with gilded images of gods
and <i>gaos</i>, small silver cases with figures of Buddha, which
on a journey are suspended by a red strap from the
shoulder. And before them flickered a wick, fed with
butter, in a bright brass bowl.</p>

<p>A servant brought cups of Chinese porcelain on copper
saucers and with silver covers. Another poured out of a
picturesque tea-pot the thick tea mixed with butter which
the Tibetans are so fond of, and which I now drank apparently
with pleasure, though to me it tasted horrible&mdash;but
Hlaje Tsering had lately praised my English tea.</p>

<p>The conversation was carried on calmly and agreeably
as in my tent. But the negotiations made no progress, but
rather the contrary, for Hlaje Tsering now said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can on no account let you go to the Dangra-yum-tso;
the lake is holy, and, besides, watchmen have already
been posted there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The road to the east is also barred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the country is entirely closed to you on the
south, west, and east, and I cannot, as I now perceive,
send you back to the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I, then, to travel through the air, or sink down
to the lower regions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you must wait here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will send my letter to Gyangtse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not do that, but I will not prevent you
from sending two of your men on your own responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you sell me some horses for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; then it would be said that we were in the same
boat, and that I had allowed myself to be bribed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fine governor, Hlaje Tsering; you cannot
even sell me a couple of horses. I shall consequently have
to send my men on foot, and they will take twice as long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will sleep on it, and let you know my decision
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span></p>

<p>Rub Das and Tundup Galzan received their instructions
in the evening. They were to take a letter to Major
O&rsquo;Connor in Gyangtse, and a sum of money was given
them, which was sewed up in their girdles for safe keeping.
They were to start on their adventurous journey the
following evening as soon as it became dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span></p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XX</p>

<p class="center chap2">ONWARDS THROUGH THE FORBIDDEN LAND</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">January</span> 13. Again this ominous number, which is regarded
by so many people as unlucky, and is surrounded
by a cloud of superstition! Would the 13th be unfortunate
for us also?</p>

<p>The sun had scarcely risen when Hlaje Tsering sent
to announce a visit. Accompanied by his private secretary,
the lama Lobsang Shunten, and all the rest of his
retinue, His Excellence the Governor of Naktsang came
to my tent on foot. They took their seats on the cushions,
and Hlaje Tsering opened the conversation with the
following remarkable declaration:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hedin Sahib, we have, neither of us, time to stay
here for weeks and months, waiting for an answer from
Gyangtse. I cannot help you in your correspondence with
Gyangtse. I have thoroughly considered the situation,
and have discussed it with my secretaries, who, like myself,
are responsible to the Devashung. We are of the opinion
that all you can do is to pass southwards into the territory
of the Labrang (Tashi-lunpo). I beg you to set out the
day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What did this most unexpected change of front mean?
Yesterday I was not to be allowed to take a single step
southwards, and to-day I was requested to start as soon as
possible to the forbidden land. Had Hlaje Tsering received
secret orders from Lhasa? Had he been informed
that the Tashi Lama was really expecting me? He said
nothing on the subject, and I cautiously refrained from
asking him. Or were we the victims of a ruse, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
we had been induced to travel with all speed to Gyangtse,
should we be compelled to return thence to India through
Darjiling? For there the Devashung could appeal to the
terms of the treaty, in which it is emphatically stipulated
that only those who are in possession of a passport from
Lhasa have a right to travel about the country, and so my
journey would be speedily ended.</p>

<p>Might it not be better to make for the unknown country
west of the Dangra-yum-tso, which after all was the main
object of my journey? Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s change of front
was so absolutely at variance with my former experiences
in Tibet, that I had some misgivings, and wondered
whether I was about to fall into the jaws of the English,
Chinese, and Tibetan authorities, and should shortly be
delivered unconditionally into their hands.</p>

<p>But this opportunity must on no account be lost.
Between the Ngangtse-tso and Shigatse stretches the
eastern part of the great white patch north of the Tsangpo,
which no European, no pundit, has trod, the land of which
not even hazy and uncertain reports at second-hand have
ever found their way into geographical text-books. Even
if I had an opportunity of making only a single traverse
over it, my labour would not be in vain. Nain Sing has
two rivers on his map, which flow east and north-east to
the Kyaring-tso, and their upper courses he places in the
country south of the Ngangtse-tso. At present I knew
nothing of them, but I should learn everything if I accepted
Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s proposal. But I had already perceived
that the mountains on the south side of the lake were quite
fanciful and arbitrary as inserted in Nain Sing&rsquo;s map. At
any rate, I must not now betray my satisfaction, so I
answered very calmly and thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will march southwards the day after to-morrow
if you will provide me with horses by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent men into all the valleys in the neighbourhood
with orders that all the available horses are to be
brought here. Two roads lead from here to Shigatse. If
you travel by the west side of the lake you will be in four
days in the territory of the Labrang, but by the east side
you will reach it in two days. You may choose yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
which way you will take, but I shall be better pleased if you
decide on the eastern, for with me the main thing is that
you should clear out of my province as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will fix on the western road, that I may be able
to make an excursion to the Dangra-yum-tso; for I wish
to see the lake, and also I must go there because I have
given it as my postal address, and the messenger of the
Tashi Lama is awaiting me there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a very undiplomatic utterance. I ought to
have avoided disclosing my plans. Hlaje Tsering bristled
up at once and exclaimed: &ldquo;To the Dangra-yum-tso?
Never! The lake is holy; the mountain Targo-gangri
on its southern shore is holy, and there lies the great
monastery Sershik-gompa, in which influential intriguing
monks dwell. Your visit to the lake would lead to complications.
No, if such is your intention, I will leave only
one road open to you, namely, that along the eastern side
of the Ngangtse-tso. I cannot and will not compel you,
but I implore you to give me your word of honour that
you will not go to the Dangra-yum-tso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus I lost the holy lake a second time; but I gave my
word of honour, that I might not lose the important route
still open to me. My premature candour vexed me at the
time, but I was soon to have reason to be thankful for it.
Had I gained an opportunity of visiting the holy lake at this
time, I should certainly have been arrested on its shore;
but that is another story which will be related in a later
chapter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Hlaje Tsering, do you think that I shall
be stopped in the territory of the Labrang?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you have not been arrested here, in Naktsang,
probably you will not be there. I do not know how I
shall get on, but I have been Governor for seven years,
and my term of office expires in five months, so it is of no
consequence if I lose my post. The Devashung has
plundered me so thoroughly that I have few cattle and little
other property left. Now, for instance, I am travelling in
my province at the expense of the people; the nomads
have to provide me with baggage animals and provisions
for the whole time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Devashung must be a nice institution. How
glad you must be that your time of service will soon
expire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I must settle down in some place where I
can live cheaply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the Devashung know that I am here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not heard anything from it up to the present,
but I despatched another report on your affairs yesterday by
express messenger. How they will treat you I do not know;
I have gone as far as I could for old friendship&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that we again paid him a return visit. Some of
Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s men had seen us engaged in rearranging
our baggage, and this caused him to ask me if he could
have an empty chest. Four of the best were given him,
and also all kinds of other superfluous articles.</p>

<p>January 13 was a memorable day in our chronicles, and
the 14th was to bring with it still more wonderful incidents.
Our life during the past months had passed rather monotonously,
but now the facts of our daily experience were
stranger than fiction. The alt-azimuth had been placed on
its tripod near my tent, and I had the chronometer, an
aneroid, and a thermometer close at hand. There I stood
for fully three hours, observing the phases of the eclipse of
the sun. About nine-tenths of the sun&rsquo;s disc were obscured.
Shortly before the maximum the temperature of the air
was 16.7°, and soon after the maximum 11.5°. The violet
line of the thermograph fell sharply, and a slight breeze
swept along the earth&rsquo;s surface. Some Tibetans had betaken
themselves to Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tent to sell us horses,
but when the singular darkness fell, they shook their heads
and returned to their tents. The Ladakis are outside,
sitting at their fire and murmuring prayers. The ravens
are quiet and do not move. An eagle circles with heavy
pinions close above the ground. Our sheep come in of
their own accord from the pastures, just as they are wont
to do in the evening, and yet the vanishing sun stands at
its mid-day altitude. The puppies break off their play,
creep timidly into the tent, and lie down on my bed.
Only the horses graze on and display no surprise that
the day is so short. All is strangely still and quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span></p>

<p>But then the small sickle of the sun, which has not been
extinguished in interstellar space, increases again. It becomes
lighter, and the shadows that have just before shown
a double outline, become sharp again. The sheep stand a
moment irresolute and then go slowly back to the pasture.
The dogs return to their play, and the Tibetans, one after
another, peep out of their tent doors. The ravens shake
themselves and fly off croaking to a hill. The prayers of
the Ladakis are heard no more, and the eagle is borne
aloft by swishing beats of his wings to the sun, which
again shines out in all its splendour.</p>

<p>Then old Karpun came to visit us, and was given some
tea, tobacco, and a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the Bombo Chimbo remember that I tried to
detain him five and a half years ago with a large levy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, on the north shore of the Selling-tso (Zilling-tso).
I gave you a great deal of trouble then, and you could not
induce me to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is all forgotten, and I am very glad to see
you again in good health and brisk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not expect then that we should meet again.
You, too, are looking well. But tell me why you are come
just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought a message to the Governor from
Shansa-dzong. The officials remaining there have ordered
me to call out the people. Now all the militia must stand
under arms to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You surely do not intend to detain me again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means. But news is come from the black
tents on the middle course of the Bogtsang-tsangpo that
a large band of robbers has pillaged ten tents and driven
off all the owners&rsquo; cattle and all the flocks of sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we may thank our stars that we did not fall into
their hands, for we passed along the middle course of the
Bogtsang-tsangpo for five days, and we have a large
quantity of silver money in our boxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bombo Chimbo is a friend of the gods. No
harm can befall you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In which direction have the robbers retired with their
booty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are still in the territory of Naktsang. We shall
pursue them, catch them, and cut off their heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I visited Hlaje Tsering with the corner pillars
of my caravan. He sat at his lacquered table drinking tea,
and had his long Chinese pipe in his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it that it has just been so dark?&rdquo; I asked
him. &ldquo;The gods of the Dangra-yum-tso are angry because
you will not allow me to visit their lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not. A big dog roams about the sky
and often conceals the sun. But I and the lama Lobsang
have prayed all the time before the altar, and have burned
joss-sticks before the images of the gods. You have
nothing to fear; the dog has passed on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fine,&rdquo; I cried, and made a desperate attempt to
explain the phenomenon. Robert held up his saucer to
represent the sun, and I took two rupees to represent the
earth and moon crossing each other&rsquo;s orbit. Hlaje Tsering
listened attentively to Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s translation of my
demonstration, nodded approvingly, and finally expressed
his opinion that all this might do very well for us, but that
it did not suit Tibet.</p>

<p>At this moment the flap of the tent was thrown back,
and Rabsang entered panting and calling out to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The post is here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muhamed Isa and Robert jumped up as though there
were fire under their feet, and exclaimed, &ldquo;We must
be off.&rdquo; I sat quite still, and thrust my feet against
the ground so as not to show that I was trembling with
excitement. Was it possible? Letters from home, from
India, from Gyangtse, and perhaps from the Tashi
Lama!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who has brought the mail?&rdquo; I asked, as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man from Shigatse, accompanied by two others,&rdquo;
answered Rabsang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he? Let him bring the mail-bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have already told him to come, but he replies
that he has strict orders to hand over the letters to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
Sahib himself in his own tent. He refuses to do so in the
tent of the Governor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Hlaje Tsering, astonished
at the general commotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have news from the Tashi Lama,&rdquo; I returned very
coolly. It was now Hlaje Tsering&rsquo;s turn to look disconcerted.
The news made a very deep impression on
him. He quickly gave an order, two men hurried out and
returned with a confirmation of my statement. Then he
gave me a friendly clap on the shoulder and said, smiling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hedin Sahib, this news is of much greater importance
to me than to you. It is of no consequence what kind of
tidings you receive, but the arrival of the post from the
Tashi Lama is, in itself, a proof that His Holiness is actually
expecting you, that Labrang is open to you, and that I
acted rightly when I told you that you might continue your
journey. If I had not already granted you permission
yesterday, I should do so now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always said that I should receive my letters
from the Tashi Lama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true; but now I have for the first time tangible
proof, now I am perfectly satisfied, and do not intend even
to wait for your departure. I shall travel back to Shansa-dzong
the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I could no longer curb my impatience. I took
leave and hurried to my tent, whither the post-messenger
was summoned. He was a young powerful Tibetan, a
servant of Kung Gushuk, one of the highest officials in
Shigatse, and younger brother of the Tashi Lama. Lieutenant
Bailey, who had taken the place of Major O&rsquo;Connor,
absent on furlough, had, according to orders from India,
sent the carefully packed post-box to the Tashi Lama
with a request that he would forward it to me. The
forbidden Dangra-yum-tso appeared in the Tibetan address
also. By command of the Tashi Lama the man was
furnished with an open passport from the Labrang, the
Vatican of Tashi-lunpo, which empowered him to demand
horses and provisions along the route. The men with him
were the nomads who had last supplied him with horses at
the Dangra-yum-tso, and now that they were sure of tips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
would not leave him. He had taken eighteen days to
travel to the holy lake, and had looked for us there for
three days, when he heard by chance that we were
encamped on the Ngangtse-tso. Then he had hastened to
us in order to execute his commission. But why was he
so late? I had arranged for November 25. Yes, but
Kung Gushuk had let the box lie for forty days, and Kung
Gushuk is a blockhead. But this was a piece of good luck.
Had Kung Gushuk done his duty, the post would have
arrived at the right time, while I only reached the place
agreed upon at the end of December. A higher providence
had overruled the whole affair, and everything turned out
well (Illustration 98).</p>

<p>Now the box was broken open. What excitement!
It contained packets of letters from my home, from the
Government House in Calcutta, from Colonel Dunlop
Smith, and many other friends. I first ascertained from
the last letter that all were well at home, and then read all
the letters in chronological order with the most eager
interest. The letters were the more welcome that they
contained nothing but good news. I received a quantity
of Swedish newspapers; they were old as the hills, but I
should now have no lack of reading on my way to Shigatse.</p>

<p>The caravan did not see much of me that evening. I
lay on my bed engaged in reading, and made my men heat
the tent well. The Ladakis, too, were merry, kindled a
large fire, danced and sang. I was invited to go and look
on at their merry-making for a moment, and availed myself
of the opportunity to make a short speech, in which I told
them that they had all served me well and faithfully, and
that hitherto we had met with good fortune. Now the
road to Tashi-lunpo was open to us, and they would attain
their wish of making a pilgrimage to the holy town. There
they would rest after their exertions. Then I returned to
my letters, and read on till the day dawned in the east, till
long after the brazier had grown cold, and there were 45
degrees of frost in my tent. But I was well wrapped
up in furs and did not feel the cold. Near my tent a troop
of wolves made such a noise that Tsering had to go out
and silence them with a few shots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span></p>

<p>On the 15th I still lay down and read. On the 16th
Hlaje Tsering paid me his farewell visit. We talked
very pleasantly together, joked, and wondered whether
fate would ever bring us together again. Then I attended
him to his horse, which was snowy white, had a crimson
saddle-cloth, and was bedecked with ornaments of shining
brass and a chest-cloth with jingling bells. He mounted
into the saddle, gave me both his hands at parting, and
disappeared with his small retinue behind the hills. Then
I again went back to my letters, but I felt a dull void now
that the amiable Governor of Naktsang was gone (Illustration
97).</p>

<p>January 17. What did it matter if the day were
gloomy, if freshly fallen snow veiled the surrounding
mountains, and heavy greyish-blue clouds rolled over the
lake as though to hide it from our sight at the moment of
our departure? To us everything seemed bright, cheerful,
and smiling. A powerful governor had come to prevent us
from travelling further, and yet the route to the south was
as free to us as the uninhabited Chang-tang had lately
been. But now we were much better off. We should pass
black tents daily, be able to buy all we wanted, and have
no cause for alarm because we had provisions for only five
days longer. We enjoyed unlimited freedom, and had not
a single man with us as escort or watchman. Before us lay
a country which might be said to be the most interesting in
the world from a geographical point of view, and in which
every day&rsquo;s journey might lead to discoveries of the highest
importance. What did we care if the air was raw and cold?
Spring must come sometime. We could count on warmer
weather for three reasons: we were advancing to more
southern climes, we should soon reach districts at a lower
level, and the spring was daily approaching. And for
three reasons the Ngangtse-tso would ever be memorable
in the diary of my reminiscences: there freedom of movement
had been unexpectedly accorded to us, there connection
with the outer world had been again established, and
there I had an opportunity of determining the depth of the
lake by a complete series of soundings, and of drawing its
contours in a map.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span></p>

<p>We had obtained three new horses fairly cheaply, on
which Robert, Muhamed Isa, and Tsering rode, while I
kept to my small Ladak white. Accompanied by the post-messenger
and his two comrades, we rode in a south-easterly
direction down to the lake, and along the eastern
shore to the southern part, where we bivouacked near two
black tents. Kiangs and wolves were frequently seen. A
kiang had been torn in pieces by the wolves, and the white
puppy and the Pobrang dog remained by the body to
enjoy a good feast. We were terribly starved during the
long march of 13.2 miles, and in the night the thermometer
marked 61.9 degrees of frost, the worst cold of the whole
winter.</p>

<p>The next day&rsquo;s march took us up a transverse valley
of the mountains which rise on the south shore of the
Ngangtse-tso. It was rather narrow, and a small source
murmured under its covering of ice. We followed a plainly
marked path, leaving a couple of tents behind us, and
passed sheepfolds, grassy plots, and dark spots where tame
yaks had lain and worn off the grass; everything was black,
the tents, the Tibetans, the half-naked children, and the
dogs. At length the gully turned westwards; just at the
bend was a waterfall congealed into milky white ice. Far
up the valley we encamped on a plateau, where we had a
very interesting view to the north-east. We could see
almost the whole of the lake which Nain Sing left at some
distance to the south of his route, and which he called
Daru-tso. I cannot dispute its correctness, but none of the
Tibetans whom I questioned had ever heard this name
for the lake; they called it Marchar-tso, and it now figures
in my map under this name. It often happens that a lake
has different names among different nomad tribes. In
camp No. 109 it lay just below us as on a map; its form is
not so simple as on Nain Sing&rsquo;s map, but abounds in
peninsulas and bays, and it is extremely narrow in the
middle. The isthmus between the Ngangtse-tso and the
Marchar-tso is only a few miles broad; at the highest
point the old shore terraces of the two lakes touch one
another. At the time when the water stood higher the
two lakes were therefore connected. The Marchar-tso is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
said to be as salt as its neighbour, but its ice was smooth
and blue, and we saw no fields of free salt on its surface.</p>

<p>We had seen nothing of the white puppy and the Pobrang
dog after we had left them behind, so I sent the Hajji
back to the lake. But he came back without having found
any sign of them. We never saw them again, and I sorely
missed the white puppy, who had been a faithful friend in
the tent and on the march. Either they had had a fight
with wolves and got the worst of it, or they had lost our
track and had been adopted by nomads. The former was
the more probable, for the Hajji when he came to the lake
saw a troop of wolves careering over the ice.</p>

<p>On the 19th we surmounted the neighbouring pass,
the Chapka-la (17,474 feet), on which a stone pyramid is
erected in honour of the gods. As a watershed it is only
of secondary importance, for the water from both sides
flows to the Ngangtse-tso. The valley leading down
makes a curve to the south; in the Lamblung valley we
had eleven tents as neighbours, and were able to provide
ourselves with all we needed for several days. The
country was still in the Naktsang territory, but the nomads
were subjects of the Labrang, and paid their taxes to
Tashi-lunpo.</p>

<p>We remained here two days, which we ought not to have
done, and we would not if I had properly considered the
matter. It was not the furious snowstorm which caused us
to waste forty-eight hours, but Ngurbu Tundup, the postman.
I had intended to keep him with us as long as possible, for
it would evidently be an advantage to us, and would
increase our dignity, to have with us a servant of one
of the highest officials of Shigatse. He was our living
passport; if he were not with us, we might perhaps again
be regarded as freebooters, and be ordered to stop by some
despotic chief. But Ngurbu Tundup was deaf to our
entreaties, and declared that he had strict orders to return
immediately his task was accomplished, and give in his
report. He had already disobeyed his orders and had lost
several days, but he consented to remain with us if we would
rest in the Lamblung valley. I had great need of the time
to get all my huge correspondence ready. On January 20
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
I wrote for sixteen hours, and by noon of the 21st the mail
was ready and packed up. Ngurbu received a present of
82 rupees for his excellent service, and if he handed over
the packet of letters to the British commercial agent in
Gyangtse he was to receive further especial reward,
when we met again at Shigatse. But he was to make
all speed, changing his horse several times a day. If he
loitered and covered only 18 miles a day, that is, reaching
Gyangtse in ten days, he was to expect only 10 rupees.
If he completed the journey in nine days, he was to
receive 20, and if he accomplished his task in eight days,
I would give him 30 rupees, and so on, at the rate
of 10 rupees for every day saved. He actually arrived
in eight days. I really committed a blunder in making
this arrangement, for I gave notice of our approach to the
south, and it might have happened that the Tibetans might
have conceived evil designs against us. Nay, had the
Chinese received news of our march, we should most
certainly have been very soon stopped.</p>

<p>When Ngurbu had ridden off over the hills, we were
again cut off from contact with the outer world, and were
left to ourselves.</p>

<p>The following morning we ascended eastwards along
the valley in which we had encamped, and where some
<i>mani</i> cists stand, the longest of which measures 33 feet,
and is covered with slabs of sandstone bearing the holy
formula in incised letters. Continual snowstorms and
huge masses of cloud with or without snow&mdash;that was
the characteristic weather in January.</p>

<p>The Pongchen-la (17,621 feet) is a low threshold, like
the preceding of secondary importance. On its summit
stands a votive stone heap, with a bundle of rods, on which
pennants, cloth rags, and ribands flutter. Smaller cairns
radiate out from it. Here we had a last glimpse of our
dear old Ngangtse-tso, and to the north-east a valley ran
down to the Marchar-tso. To the south-east rose a dark
range with several snowy peaks, which is called Pabla. The
valley we traversed is broad and open, and is enclosed in
low mountains. We saw no tents all the day, but numerous
traces of summer encampments. Namgyal, however, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
is a quick intelligent man, spied out two tents in the neighbourhood
of our camp No. 111, which was pitched in a
district called Namachang, and there bought some sheep,
parched meal, barley, milk, and sour milk. He also
brought a young Tibetan with him, who was good-looking,
honest, and gentle, and did all we asked him willingly and
pleasantly. His accent was so soft and refined that it was
a pleasure to hear him speak. He gave me a quantity
of credible information and promised to accompany us a
day&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p>It snowed so thickly all night and the following day
that I frequently could not see Rabsang, who marched with
the Tibetan guide just in front of my horse. The snow
enveloped us, whirled about us, and piled itself into small
drifts on the sheltered side of every stone, grassy hillock,
and hollow. The valley slopes gently to the south-east,
and its frozen river is called Buser-tsangpo, and is a
tributary of the Tagrak-tsangpo, which debouches into
the south-western corner of the Ngangtse-tso. We are
therefore still in the basin, of which the lake occupies the
lowest part, and of which the border on the north-west
and east lies close to the lake, but on the south is removed
many days&rsquo; journey from it. The camping-ground this day
is called Kapchor; eastwards extends an open longitudinal
valley, through which runs the road to Shansa-dzong; on
the north side also of the Ngangtse-tso and Marchar-tso a
road runs thither, and by this Hlaje Tsering had reached
our camp in twelve days. This road is known from Nain
Sing&rsquo;s journey in 1873-74.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th we were nearly blinded on
going out of our tents, so brilliant was the reflexion from
the thousands of small facets of the snow crystals which
had spread their white cloak over hill and valley in a thick
continuous sheet. The sky was clear, and blue as the
purest turquoise from Nishapur, but the wind swept bitterly
cold over the snowfields a night old. Our route ran south-eastwards
to the exit of the narrow valley where the
Tagrak-tsangpo, now frozen to the bottom, rested mute
and motionless in the arms of winter. We followed the
river, the largest watercourse that we had seen since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
Chang-chenmo, upwards. At some places small nomad
communities had their winter pastures, and there large
herds of yaks and flocks of sheep roamed over the slopes.
The name of the valley is Kayi-rung, of the spot where
camp 113 was pitched Kayi-pangbuk, and of the district
Tova-tova. Nain Sing&rsquo;s Dobo Dobá Cho, from which he
brings the river Para-tsangpo to the Kyaring-tso, was not
known to the inhabitants. The Pundit makes the water
drain eastwards, but as a matter of fact it runs westwards
and north-westwards to the Ngangtse-tso. This is due to
his not having been here himself, for the statements of the
natives are usually very unreliable.</p>

<p>Immediately beyond the camp we crossed on the 25th
a small saddle, where we obtained an instructive insight
into the lie of the land. The eyes swept unhindered over
all the wide plain, with the three streams forming the
Tagrak-tsangpo meandering over the level ground in
capricious curves and bends like silver ribands in the
brown and grey country. Close to us on the south-east
is the Kesar-tsangpo, which receives the Naong-tsangpo at
the foot of our gap, and then cutting through our mountain
begins its course in the Kayi-rung valley. Farther off to
the north-east the Naong-tsangpo has already absorbed
the waters of the Kung-tsangpo, and with them makes
its way to the Kayi-rung valley and the Ngangtse-tso.
The great plain is enclosed by moderately high, rounded
mountains and hills.</p>

<p>After crossing the Kesar-tsangpo we follow the right
bank, upwards as far as Toa-nadsum, where we bivouac.
A quadrangular wall of earth marks the spot where the
<i>bombo</i>, or chief of the district, usually erects his tent; now
he is in Tashi-lunpo to pay his tax. In the adjoining
valleys there are at the present time twenty-two tents, but
only four near our camp, and in these beggars are wintering
in great poverty. The country is said to be noted for
its cold, raw climate even in summer. It rains in June
and July, but the fall varies very much from year to year.
If it rains hard for a long time, all the rivers swell, draining
water from a thousand valleys, and the Tagrak-tsangpo is
then sometimes unfordable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span></p>

<p>When we started on the following day in a twilight
caused by heavy clouds, the poor natives came up holding
out their hands for <i>tsamba</i> or money, and each received a
coin. Our way ran to the east-south-east, to the Naong-rung
valley, traversed by the Naong-tsangpo, now frozen to
the bottom. We now ascended gradually, and at camp
No. 115 found ourselves at a height of 16,844 feet.</p>

<p>Two large black nomad dogs fell in love with the brown
puppy, and followed us as though they belonged to the
family. One limped, having at some time hurt his leg;
he was old and shaggy, and was received with stones and
abuse. Yet he clung to us faithfully, and put up with hard
words from the men and the offal from slaughtered sheep.
He was at last admitted a member of our travelling company,
and hobbled, with drooping head and tongue hanging
out, over lofty passes and through deep valleys, and
answered to the name of &ldquo;Cripple.&rdquo; As he was old he
often lagged behind, but in spite of his slow pace he always
turned up and took his place before Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s tent.
He was the grand dog of our tent court, and was much
concerned about us when danger threatened. Naturally
he became a friend of us all, was allowed to eat as much as
he liked, and acquired a position in the caravan. Then we
would gladly have forgotten we had had the heart to beat
him, and to greet him with stones and whips&mdash;he, our
Cripple, who had come to us of his own accord to defend
us and guard our tents, only asking free board in exchange;
for free lodging of course he had under the everlasting
stars in great desolate winterly cold Tibet.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">January</span> 27. Storm as usual. We march in a south-easterly
direction, guided by the river system of the
Tagrak-tsangpo, which branches off into smaller and
smaller ramifications, and no one interferes with us or
takes the slightest notice of our advance. From a small
pass we look down on the two tributaries of the Naong-tsangpo,
the Pupchung-tsangpo, and the Kelung-tsangpo,
and follow the latter. It conducts us to a second saddle
with a stone cairn and prayer streamers; from a pole in
the middle strings radiate out to the four cardinal points,
bearing rags and ribands, and fastened to the ground
by small stones. From a third watershed of secondary
rank the guide points out a pass of the first order in the
Pabla mountains which we shall cross to-morrow. We
now find ourselves in a high alpine region without herbage;
only moss grows among the pebbles. Camp No. 116 is pitched
in the valley of the Pupchung-tsangpo. The brook descends
from the Pupchung-ri, a part of the main crest. To the south-east
we see the two mountains Tormakaru and Sangra covered
with snow. Here nomads never encamp, for the elevation
is too great. Only when officials from Tashi-lunpo travel
here on duty are the nomads living nearest obliged to set
up tents for them.</p>

<p>The wind sank in the evening, and the sound of the flutes
echoed clearly and sweetly in the valley. The moon
rose high, and poured down its light over the peaceful
wondrous land. The night advanced cold and silent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
the thermometer fell to &minus;29°. At such a temperature
there is no need of draughts through the chinks to cool
the sleeping-tent. The cold wakes me up, and I have to
wrap myself more closely in my blankets.</p>

<p>January 28 was a great day in our records. We knew
that we had a trying way before us, and therefore we made
an early start. The horse that bore the number 22 on
the label attached to his mane lay before my tent frozen
hard, with his legs stretched out; he had served us faithfully
for nearly half a year. Seven horses and a mule were
left. They carried nothing but the cloths that protected
them from cold in the night. The new Tibetan horses
were in splendid condition: they were fat and sleek compared
to our old horses, which had passed through the
winter on the Chang-tang.</p>

<p>Even at ten o&rsquo;clock the wind is icy cold, and not the
smallest cloud floats over the earth. Dull weather is much
better if the air be still. Now the sun looks down sneeringly
on our sufferings and makes no attempt to lighten them. We
march towards the east-south-east, over an endless, slightly
undulating plain, where the ground consists of troublesome
moss-grown stones and sharp débris. On our right is the
Sangra peak and other parts of the Pabla crest, whence
short transverse valleys descend, and are continued over
the plain in insignificant furrows of erosion. To the left
the land is undulating, where the affluents of the Naong-tsangpo
wind among softly rounded hills. Higher hills
and ridges, lying to the north of the right bank of the
Naong-tsangpo, intercept the view in this direction.</p>

<p>So we mount slowly up till a deeply eroded valley
suddenly and unexpectedly appears on the right side of
our route. It is not included in the Ngangtse-tso basin.
I am about to leave the isolated hydrographic region, and
puzzle my head about the surprises that await me. The
valley is called Sangra-palhe, runs south-eastwards, and
receives the southern transverse valleys of the Pabla,
which are just as deeply excavated. To the south-east
we see the dark extremity of a spur of the Pabla, round
which the great main valley and its stream bend towards
the south and pass on&mdash;but whither? On this point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
the guide could give us no information; we were to find
out later. Farther on we reach a valley running in a
northerly direction, and therefore connected with the
Naong-tsangpo. Northwards the country slopes gently,
but steeply, to the south, and we ascend to the low pass
forming the watershed. Immediately beyond the hill
Sereding we march up a steep ascent towards the conical
mountain Serpo-tsunge, which we afterwards leave close
on the right of our road. From its western and eastern
sides, and also from the gap where we now stand, a number
of deep erosion valleys run down to the Sangra-palhe. To
the left of our route a valley, which still belongs to the
system of the Naong-tsangpo, slopes to the north-west.
We are therefore on the water-parting ridge. The Serpo-tsunge
is a geographical boundary pillar, and marks where
the domain of the Ngangtse-tso ends. The whole configuration
is singularly complicated.</p>

<p>Here we left one of our yaks, which could not be
induced by coaxing or scolding to move a step farther,
but lowered his horns and rushed at those who attempted
to drive him on. He was abandoned, the second animal of
his kind. He had here abundance of yak-moss, snow, and
fresh air, and would probably fall into the hands of the
nomads some time or other.</p>

<p>A little higher and we stood on the very summit of the
pass, marked by a pole with streamers, which flap and flutter
in the wind. It was quite time that we made a small fire,
for we were half dead with cold. It was not easy to make
the hypsometer boil. Robert sat on the ground and
improvised a tent round the instrument with furs and
a rug, while I lay on my stomach on the lee side and read
the thermometer through a small opening. The temperature
was 15°, with a west-south-west wind No. 8, that is,
half a gale. The valley leading down, the Sele-nang,
lay now, at mid-day, in dark shadow. Through its opening
appeared a vast sea of rigid mountainous undulations, steep
cliffs, and deep valleys, no level stretches, no vegetation, only
a labyrinth of mountains, a much bolder, more marked, and
wilder relief than we had seen in Chang-tang. The nearer
parts of the Pabla ridge intercepted the view to the west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span></p>

<p>The pass, where we now were, is called the Sela-la, and
attains the great height of 18,064 feet above sea-level. I
perceived clearly that it must be situated in the main
chain, which, farther east, bears the well-known peak
Nien-chang-tang-la on the south shore of the Nam-tso or
Tengri-nor, and has been crossed by a few Europeans and
pundits. It is one of the greatest and grandest watersheds
of the world, for from its northern flank the water flows
down to the undrained lakes of the plateau, and from its
southern flank to the Indian Ocean. The course of this
watershed and the configuration of the mountain system
crossed by our route between the Ngangtse-tso and Yeshung
on the Tsangpo was till this January of 1907 as
unknown to geographers of European race as the side of
the moon turned away from the earth. On the other hand,
the seas and mountains seen in the full moon have been
known from ancient times much better than the region of
the earth&rsquo;s surface whither it is my good fortune to be
able to conduct my readers. I venture to describe this
geographical problem that I have succeeded in solving as
one of the finest, perhaps the most striking, of all problems
connected with the surface of our earth that awaited solution.</p>

<p>But on the Sela-la we crossed the immense watershed
only at a single point. I will not anticipate events. We
must first muster our acquisitions in order, and then we
will draw our conclusions from the material collected.
And now we will continue our arduous passage through
the unknown world of mountains which still separates us
from the great river.</p>

<p>After I had hastily sketched the panorama with hands
turned blue with cold, inserting the names the guide was
able to give me, we hurried down the slopes of detritus,
partially covered with snow, on the south side of the pass.
In the valley bottom, with its patches of ice, we mounted
our horses again, and met three mounted Tibetans driving
before them eight loose horses. As soon as they caught
sight of us they turned aside and made a great detour to
avoid us. We supposed that they belonged to a band of
robbers, who wished to escape with their booty by untrodden
paths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span></p>

<p>It was delightful this evening to sit at length in the
warmth of the camp-fire. In silent meditation my eyes
swept from the rocky crests, brightly lighted by the moon,
down to the dark shadowy depths of the valley, where there
were only wolves crouching in their holes. It seemed as
though all belonged to me; as though I had marched into
this land a conqueror at the head of victorious legions, and
had crushed all opposition. Oh, what splendid legions!
Five-and-twenty ragged fellows from Ladak, ten lean
jades, and about twenty worn-out yaks. And yet I had
succeeded! Marius could not have been prouder of the
triumphs he achieved in the war against Jugurtha than I
was when I had won my first victory over the &ldquo;Trans-Himalaya&rdquo;
at the Sela-la, that Sela-la which, now bathed in
moonlight, seemed to us the extreme outpost on the limits
of boundless space.</p>

<p>Our march on January 29 was pleasant. We were
sheltered from the wind in the deep valley, travelled
towards the sun, and felt the first touch of the approaching
spring. We rode at first towards the east-south-east, but
gradually made a curve round to the south. Just at the
bend the valley Tumsang runs in, and in the background
we again caught a glimpse of a part of the great range we
crossed at the Sela-la. Innumerable valleys such as ours
must descend from the crest more or less parallel to it.
The valley becomes broader, and the ice strip of the
Sele-nang winds along the middle. We see no tents, but
places where they are pitched in summer, and some <i>manis</i>
are erected for the edification of travellers. Camp No.
118 is pitched in an expansion of the valley called Selin-do.</p>

<p>During the past days we had often remarked how
desirable it would be if we could hire some yaks from
the nomads. Our own were exhausted and kept us back,
and in the high country with its abundant detritus, where
we were now travelling, their hoofs became sorer every
day. As long as the land lay open before us we must
make all haste we could. Delay might be dangerous, but
the yaks marched as though they had a log at their heels.
We saw no tents in Selin-do, but Namgyal came in the
evening with two Tibetans he had met in a side valley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
They were willing to provide us with 25 yaks, if they were
paid a <i>tenga</i> (about 5½ d.) for every day&rsquo;s march, and they
reckoned eight days&rsquo; march for the journey to Yeshung on
the Tsangpo. They would accompany us themselves only
for one day, and insisted that other men should take their
place when they turned back. We could not do any better;
we should spare our own animals, make longer marches,
and obtain good guides as well.</p>

<p>In the evening we received a visit from seven well-armed
riders in search of a band of robbers who had
stolen several horses from them. We informed them of
the party we had met the day before and they rode off,
thanking us warmly, up the valley.</p>

<p>January 30. In the morning our new friends turned
up with the yaks; when all was in order we found that we
possessed only eighteen loads of the heavy baggage with
which we set out from Leh. Our last two guides were
paid, and immediately set out for the Sela-la.</p>

<p>Immediately below camp No. 118 the Selin-do valley
unites with the Porung valley, along which we again
ascended to the south-east. I was surprised that our
guides tramped up to higher ground again, but they
followed a plainly marked path, while the valley that we
left on the right seemed to slope down to the west-south-west
and south-west. They said that it debouched into
the valley of the My-tsangpo, a northern tributary of the
Yere-tsangpo (the upper Brahmaputra). I had afterwards
an opportunity of ascertaining that their statements were
correct. But now, on first crossing the country, the
arrangement of the mountain ranges and watercourses
was ill-defined and confusing to me. At every camp I
interrogated Tibetans who seemed reliable, and made them
draw small maps with their fingers in the sand, which I
copied into my diary. But the map changed every day,
even if the chief lines remained the same.</p>

<p>From the point where we began to ascend again a
desolate chaos of mountains is visible towards the south-west.
On the right bank of the Porung several warm
springs well up from the pebble bed, containing sulphurous
water at a temperature of 127.9° and filling basins in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
the hot steaming water simmers and bubbles. The place
is called simply Tsaka-chusen, or &ldquo;The Hot Salt Water.&rdquo;
The terraces of the valley indicate powerful erosive action.
Side valleys run in on both sides; sometimes we cross the
frozen stream, sometimes pass over steep mountain spurs.
At a bend in the way we meet a party of armed riders who
are on the way to Chokchu, a country west of the Dangra-yum-tso.</p>

<p>We come to an expansion in the valley, a very important
spot, for here several valleys converge to a gigantic
focus of erosion in this sea of wild mountains. The largest
is the Terkung-rung, which, joined by a whole series of
side valleys, descends from the main crest of the Pabla in
the north-east. The track through the valley passes
several large summer pastures. I made a long halt on
a broad rocky projection with a <i>mani</i> to get my bearings
in this extremely interesting country. Here, too, we met
a mounted party, which was in pursuit of a freebooter who
had eloped with another man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;just as with us.
The injured husband was in the party and looked very
furious. Then we met a caravan of 55 yaks laden with
great bales of Chinese brick tea from Lhasa, which they
were carrying to the Chokchu province. A dozen dark
bare-footed men followed the animals, singing and whistling,
spinning woollen thread with the help of vertical rotating
spools, or engaged with their prayer mills. They hired
their yaks, and were to exchange them for fresh animals
at Selin-do. They had also 50 sheep with them, carrying
small loads of barley. The farther we advanced the more
lively became the traffic.</p>

<p>Small footpaths from the side valleys join our road,
which is now broad and shows signs of considerable
traffic. All our guides tell us that this is the great highway
to Shigatse, and is also a section of the main road
connecting Chokchu with the capital of the country. The
road is a collection of parallel footpaths, and where it
crosses slopes and steep declivities appears like stripes
on the ground.</p>

<p>We continue our ascent in a south-south-easterly
direction, and find ourselves about 100 feet above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
valley bottom, which is occupied by a huge ice-belt of
uniform breadth resembling a great river; we could fancy
ourselves transplanted to the Indus valley in its winter
dress as seen from Saspul. But the resemblance is only
apparent, for after we have passed some rather large side
valleys we reach the abundant springs of Mense-tsaka
with warm freshwater at a temperature of 118°, which
farther down forms pools where small fishes dart about
among slimy weeds. The water gradually cools down and
forms ice, and runs down over it farther and farther until,
as now in the end of January, it has filled the whole valley
bottom from the foot of one flank to the other.</p>

<p>From the great meeting-place of the valleys we have
passed four <i>manis</i>, in general not more than 10 feet long,
but covered with unusually well-dressed slabs of red, white,
or green sandstone and slate. On the former, the letters in
the weathered crust stand out bright red against the chiselled
intervals with their white surface. We are tempted to take
away some specimens, but we shall probably have later
opportunities of committing sacrilege.</p>

<p>In front of us stands the trough up to the pass; surrounded
by the concave crest, where the caravan is seen
on the top, the pass seems unpleasantly steep. Above the
valleys Shib-la-yilung and Chugge-lung the ascent is
difficult, and the horses often pause on the slopes of
detritus. At last, however, we are up at the votive cairn
with its streamer pole amongst smaller pyramids of stones.
This is the Shib-la, which has a height of 17,549 feet. The
view is magnificent and is free on almost all sides, for no
summits in the foreground obstruct it. Down in the
valleys we were sheltered from the wind, but up on the
summit it sweeps unhindered over the agitated sea of
crests.</p>

<p>The guide points south-westwards to the next pass we
have to cross. Between it and the Shib-la stretches a deep
boldly eroded ravine, sloping to the west-south-west. Its
river, or rather its ice-belt, unites with all the watercourses
we have crossed this day&mdash;with all, indeed, that we have
met with since the Sela-la. We have therefore crossed a
number of tributaries, but the main stream, which receives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
them all, lies to the west of our route and is not visible
from any point. It is the river called My-chu, My-tsangpo,
or My-chu-tsangpo.</p>

<p>We had still a fairly long march to the camp. It grew
dusk. We descended the steep slope on foot, stumbling
over the rubbish and the mouse-holes. Darkness came on,
but a white streak was seen in the valley, the ice of the
river. The light of the camp-fire looked tempting in the
cold and darkness. But nothing is so deceptive as a blaze
of light in the darkness; you go on and on, but the fire
seems no larger. At last, however, tired and starved, we
arrived at the camp and sat as close as possible to the
glowing <i>argol</i>, and the conversation with Muhamed Isa
began&mdash;cheerful and animated, as usual.</p>

<p>Four of our spare yaks were thoroughly exhausted and
must have a day&rsquo;s rest. Had I known what was coming
behind in our track, I would have left them and hurried off
next morning. But we knew nothing, and spent the last
day of January quietly in camp No. 119. The thermometer
fell to &minus;29.9°: the third time we had recorded the same
reading.</p>

<p>I spent the leisure day in studying the maps I had
drawn, and endeavouring to form a clear conception of the
mountains and valleys among which we had been wandering.
This much was evident, that the great watershed
between the isolated lake basins of the Chang-tang and the
Indian Ocean ran along the main Pabla range, and that this
was the immediate western prolongation of the mighty
chain Nien-chen-tang-la. We had crossed the Pabla
mountains at the Sela-la, and were now in the wide-stretching
intricate river system of the My-chu. Nearly
parallel to the My-chu flows farther east the Shang-chu,
and along its valley the Pundit Krishna (A. K.) travelled
in the year 1872 and Count de Lesdain in 1905. Between
the My-chu and the Shang-chu there must therefore be a
secondary watershed and a considerable mountain elevation,
which is really nothing else than an offshoot from the main
range of the Pabla. All the watercourses we had crossed
from the Sela-la onwards flow westwards, and the secondary
watershed, where they take their rise, lies to the east of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
our route. It is, however, possible that between the My-chu
and the Shang-chu another, or perhaps several valleys
lie, equal in importance to the valleys of these rivers.</p>

<p>The Pabla is only a part of the main chain of the
&ldquo;Trans-Himalaya,&rdquo; and the Trans-Himalaya is not only
a watershed of the first rank, but is also a geographical
boundary of exceptional importance. I have now and
then wandered through mountain regions of awful
grandeur, but have never seen anything to equal the
country to the south of the Trans-Himalaya. In Chang-tang
the predominating lines of the landscape are slightly
undulating and horizontal; now we had reached the
peripheral regions, having a drainage to the sea, and
immediately vertical lines came into prominence. On the
south side of the Trans-Himalaya the valleys are much more
boldly excavated in the rock masses than in any part of the
plateau country. And why? Because the precipitation
from the monsoon clouds is incomparably more abundant
on the south side of the Trans-Himalaya than on the
northern flank. It is the same in the Himalayas, where
the south side, facing the west monsoon, catches the lion&rsquo;s
share of the precipitation, and is irrigated by much more
abundant and more continuous rains than the northern.
Now we found springs, brooks, and rivers in every valley,
while not very long before we were always in danger of
finding no water. In climatic relations, then, the Trans-Himalaya
is a boundary line equalled in magnitude and
importance by few on the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>

<p>My excitement and expectation were constantly increasing;
every day I saw plainer indications of the
proximity of a religious metropolis&mdash;votive cairns, <i>manis</i>,
travellers, caravans were all signs of it. My Ladakis were
inspired by the same feeling of exultation which the
pilgrims of Islam experience when they approach the
Arafat mountain, and remember that from that elevation
they will behold for the first time the holy Mecca.</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon fresh men with fresh yaks
presented themselves to take over our loads on February 1.
I could not understand why the nomads were ready to serve
us without the slightest suggestion. Certainly the highway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
is divided into stages, and fresh yaks are kept in
readiness for the transport of baggage and goods, but
these advantages are intended only for Tibetans, not for a
European caravan, which had not even a passport. At
any rate Ngurbu Tundup had done us no harm; on the
contrary, it was known everywhere that I was coming,
and that he was a messenger sent to me by the Tashi
Lama. At every halting-place we were told how many
days ago he had passed through the place. The readiness
of the nomads to provide us with yaks was due in no
small degree to the good pay and kind treatment they
received. Now our own yaks travelled without loads, and
also the seven Ladak horses and the last surviving mule.
But we were prepared for any emergency. We had agreed
that if we could not at any time find transport animals, I,
with Muhamed Isa and Namgyal, would ride on our three
Tibetan horses in forced marches to Shigatse, while the
caravan would follow slowly under Robert&rsquo;s command.</p>

<p>We had 58½ degrees of frost in the night, and the
morning was horribly cold, dull, and stormy. We ascended
to the next pass along a new valley. We had not gone
far before we were half dead with cold; Robert wept, he
was so frozen. When it was warmest, there were still 27½
degrees of frost, and a biting wind blew in our faces. Our
faces, and especially our noses, would have been frost-bitten
if we had not constantly put them in the openings of our
long fur sleeves, where, however, the breath turned so
quickly to ice that the sleeve froze on to the moustache.
It is not easy to do map work under such circumstances.
Before I have taken my observation and looked at the
watch my left hand is dead; and, however much I hurry,
I have not recorded the result before my right hand has
lost all feeling. It is impossible to march on foot in face of
the storm up a steep ascent and in the rarefied air if one
has the least respect for one&rsquo;s heart. We crept into a cave
and crouched down on the sheltered side; we thrust our
hands between the horse and the saddle-girth to thaw
them; we stamped our feet, and looked intensely miserable
when the muscles of our faces were so benumbed that we
could hardly speak. &ldquo;Let us ride on; we will light a fire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
up above.&rdquo; And so we struggled painfully up through
sharp-edged detritus and among stones.</p>

<p>At last we are up on the flat arch of the Chesang-la at
an absolute height of 17,599 feet. This pass is therefore a
little higher than the Sela-la, but nevertheless it is only a
pass of the second rank, for it separates two of the affluents
of the My-chu. When we came up, there were three large
grey wolves on the pass, but they quickly took to flight.
Here the storm raged in uncontrolled freedom, and we
could scarcely keep on our feet. Robert and I crouched
on the ground on the sheltered side of the large cairn,
while Rabsang and our Tibetan guide collected dry yak-dung.
We set it alight with the help of flint and steel, and
then we all four cowered over the fire. We opened our fur
coats to let a little heat penetrate our clothes and took
off our boots to warm our feet, but we sat an hour and a half
before we felt anything like human beings again. Then
we hastened down in a south-south-westerly direction
and encamped in the Sham valley near some wretched
stone huts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span></p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXII</p>

<p class="center chap2">TO THE BANK OF THE BRAHMAPUTRA</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> Sham valley narrows like a pear, and at the entrance
of this funnel huts stand at three different spots, and large
herds graze on the mountain slopes. A <i>mani</i>, 148 feet
long by 5 feet high, was covered with clods to protect the
upright stones sculptured with prayers. At length the
Sham valley enters a large valley coming from the east,
which occupies a prominent place in this river system. It
is traversed by the Bup-chu-tsangpo, the largest river we
have yet seen. Immediately below the place where the
two valleys unite is the confluence of a third river, which
is called Dangbe-chu and flows from the south-east.
Thus three considerable streams meet in this small
expansion of the valley. The explanations of my guide
made this complicated river system of the My-chu-tsangpo
clear to me. The sources of the Bup-chu-tsangpo lie two
long days&rsquo; march to the east, and are of course to be found
in the great offshoot of the Pabla which forms on the east
the watershed of the My-chu-tsangpo. From the confluence
where we now stood the Bup-chu-tsangpo continues its
course for two short days&rsquo; journey south-westwards, and
then at the monastery Linga-gompa enters the My-chu-tsangpo,
which has its source in the main range of the
Pabla.</p>

<p>The Bup-chu-tsangpo was at this season converted into
a huge sheet of ice, but had an open water channel. We
crossed dry-footed at a place where the ice formed a bridge
all across the bed of the stream, and then marched in a
south-easterly direction through the narrow Dangbe valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span></p>

<p>At camp No. 121, on February 3, we left Tundup
Sonam and Tashi behind with our own yaks, which were
so exhausted that they could be driven only very slowly.
The men were given money for their keep, and were
ordered to move on towards Shigatse at a very slow pace.
The rest of the caravan set out early, in good weather and
at a minimum temperature of only 11.3°.</p>

<p>Our course is south-south-east and afterwards east.
All the valleys are full of ice, which we strew with sand
as the caravan passes. The pass to-day is the Dangbe-la,
decorated, as usual, with a cairn and streamers; its height
is 17,224 feet, or much less than that of the preceding pass.
It is interesting, as lying on the watershed between the
Bup-chu (My-chu) and the Rung-chu. The latter river
does not unite with the My-chu, but takes its own course
direct to the upper Brahmaputra. When I asked why we
could not descend the Rung valley to avoid the two passes
in front of us, I was told that the valley is very narrow, is
confined by precipitous mountains, and is filled with ice.
There is, however, a path used in summer which runs
sometimes along the slopes, sometimes over the valley
bottom, but is hard to follow after rain, for then large
volumes of water pour down the valley, thundering over
falls and rapids.</p>

<p>We bivouacked in a locality called Ngartang in the
Rung valley, where twelve tents remain standing all
through the year. The valley is considered cold, whereas
the Sham is reputed warm. Indeed, we had found there
some juniper bushes, and were so delighted at seeing them
that we had adorned the inside of our tents with branches.
It never snows in summer in the Sham valley, but it does
in the Rung valley. In many years there is much rain
in both valleys.</p>

<p>As though to prove the truth of the Tibetans&rsquo; assertions,
the thermometer again fell in the night to &minus;19.1°. We
were prepared for a long day&rsquo;s journey and a difficult pass,
and therefore it was still dark when I heard the yaks being
driven into the camp. After we have left the Ma-lung river
behind us we ride up hills consisting of firm soil overgrown
with moss, and an inextricable entanglement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
mountains is displayed to our view. We ride steeply
upwards along the valley coming down from the pass,
passing over detritus and among boulders, with votive
cairns here and there. A stretch of almost level ground
follows, and then at last the path rises steeply to the pass,
which is strewn with innumerable blocks of grey granite.
This is the Ta-la or &ldquo;Horse Pass,&rdquo; and its absolute height
is 17,835 feet.</p>

<p>If the ascent among the boulders is troublesome, and
both horse and rider have to twist their bodies in all kinds
of acrobatic feats, the pilgrim is richly rewarded when he
stands at the top of the Ta-la beside the streamer-decked
cairn; for anything grander and more overpowering I
have never yet seen, unless it were on the top of the
Chang-lung-yogma. The panorama to the south-east
and east-south-east is so fascinating that we almost forget
to dismount. We command a somewhat limited portion
of the horizon, for two peaks of the Ta-la crest, like the
portal of a great temple, close in the landscape in front of
us. Below is a zone of reddish-brown, dome-shaped hills,
behind them a nearly black spur, intersected by numerous
short transverse valleys, and farther in the background a
dark grey ramification. All seem to run westwards and
from the watershed, which we have supposed to lie to the
east of our route since we crossed the Sela-la. Such
scenery as this we had gazed upon time after time. But
high above the dark-grey ridge rises a world of mountains
which seems to belong to the heavens rather than the
earth, so lightly and airily is it poised above the rest of the
earth under a canopy of white clouds. It is so far from us
that the individual contours are indistinguishable, and it
rises like a wall of a universal light blue hue, which, however,
is a little deeper than the colour of the sky. The
boundary between the two expanses of blue is sharply
marked by an irregular bright white line; for what we
see before us is the snow-covered crest of the Himalayas,
and behind it lies India with its eternal summer. These
are the most northern chains of the Himalayas, on the
frontier between Tibet and Bhotan. Between them and
the dark grey crest, comparatively near to us, yawns an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
abyss, a huge fissure on the earth&rsquo;s crust, the valley of the
Brahmaputra or Tsangpo. The river itself is not visible,
but we feel that we are now not far from our destination.
Ah, you fearful ranges and passes which we have surmounted
in the Chang-tang, where dead horses mark the miles and
show in which direction we travelled, at last we have you behind
us, and only a single mountain system, the Himalayan,
separates us from India! This view strikes us dumb, and
it seems wonderful to me that I have succeeded in forcing
my way so far.</p>

<p>Tsering and Bolu now reach the pass with the small
caravan. They fall on their knees before the heap of
stones and recite their prayers, and Tsering tears a strip
off his ragged coat to tie as an offering on to one of the
strings. We all feel as though we were on a pilgrimage.
The Tibetans who let their yaks on hire see after the
loading and unloading, gather fuel, and relieve the Ladakis
of many of their duties. The older men of our own people
are allowed to ride. They have easier work in every way,
but still they are pilgrims on the way to one of the greatest
centres of Lamaism. Old Tsering holds his cap in his
hand as he goes over the pass, and cannot turn his eyes
aside from the dreamy light-blue mountains which gleam
in the distance among the clouds. He reminds himself
that they rise far beyond Tashi-lunpo and that we have
not to cross them to reach our longed-for destination.</p>

<p>But we must leave this grand pass, the never-to-be-forgotten
Ta-la. Down we go on a break-neck descent
among boulders, between steep cliffs, over landslips and
spurs, and the Himalayas gradually vanish from sight.
Now we see only the line of the crest tipped with eternal
snow; after we have descended a couple of slopes, it also
is concealed by the dark grey ridge, and our horizon is
bounded by its sharp outline. Kabbalo is a village of two
tiny stone cabins in the Permanakbo-tang valley where we
encamp. Several Tibetans are out of doors and stare at
us; for dinner I have butter and radishes, and see no
more of the perpetual mutton.</p>

<p>On February 5 we made a short march down the same
valley, which is called Dokang, where we set up our camp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
No. 124. Forty Tibetans stood at the camp-fire. When I
rode up they all thrust out their tongues as far as they
would go, and their bright red colour formed a strong
contrast to the dirty faces. Those who wore caps took
them off with the left hand and scratched their heads with
the right&mdash;another form of salutation. When we spoke
with them they repeatedly shot out their tongues, but only
from politeness and friendliness; they could not do enough
to show their goodwill. Near the camp are the ruins of a
<i>dzong</i>, or fort, which is called Dokang-pe, and a deserted
village called Arung-kampa testifies that the valley was
formerly more densely populated than now.</p>

<p>The march on the 6th is one I shall never forget; for
now we rode down the gigantic staircase, the edge of the
Chang-tang, into the Ginunga gap which we had seen from
the Ta-la, and in the depths of which flows the upper
Brahmaputra. From the camp we marched towards the
south-south-east, leaving our river on the right, which,
cutting through the mountains in a deep ravine, flows to the
Rung-chu. At the entrance of the narrow valley stands
a small temple, the Chega-gompa. A pack of wolves howled
dismally in a gorge. The ascent to the pass La-rock (14,567
feet) is short and easy, and before we were aware we were
up at a great cairn amid smaller heaps of stones, where the
<i>tarpoche</i> (votive pole) stands grey and cracked, and much
worn by wind and weather (Illustration 100). Several
blocks of stone lying in heaps on the east side of the pass
were white-washed on their upright sides. We had to
cross over two more smaller ridges before we had a free
and uninterrupted view. The scene is grand, and reminds
one of the landscape seen from the palace at Leh. The
northern ranges of the Himalayas were distinctly visible,
but heavy clouds rested like a canopy on their peaks.
Mount Everest, therefore, the highest mountain of the
world, could not be seen. The Tsangpo appeared as a
very small bright riband, still at a considerable distance.
Below us flowed the Rung-chu, which we could see from
the place where it emerges from the mountains. Most
imposing are the colossal offshoots and ramifications of
the mountains lying to the east and west of our position,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
which fall suddenly to the valley of the Brahmaputra like
an endless row of tiger&rsquo;s claws.</p>

<p>The plain stretched out before us is a very large
expansion of the Brahmaputra valley, and is named Ye,
or Yeshung, while the river is here called the Yere-tsangpo.
It is densely peopled; the great number of dark
specks are all villages. To the right, at the foot of a
mountain spur, stands the large monastery Tashi-gembe,
which with its numerous white-washed houses has the
appearance of an Italian coast town. Thence a road runs
to the famous monastery Sekya. A fine line meandering
towards the south-east is the great highway to Shigatse,
Tashi-lunpo, and Lhasa.</p>

<p>From the last platform the path plunges down headlong,
so we descend on foot these steep slopes of grey
granite rounded by wind and weather. Where loose
material fills up the interstices the path is sunk in to
the depth of a yard. Many pilgrims, horses, and yaks
have passed here before the path became so small. Sometimes
we have abysses beside us, sometimes we slide down
over the sheets of granite, sometimes we step down as on a
staircase, but down we go, ever downwards, and we rejoice
to think that every step brings us nearer to warmer, denser
air, where we can breathe more easily. Here and there
tower up great round granite blocks on a pedestal of loose
rubbish, like glacier tables; rain and wind have sculptured
out these singular forms.</p>

<p>At last we are down on the great plain into which all
the valleys open. We ride past barley-fields, poplar groves,
farms and villages with white houses, where blue and red
pennants and flags decorate the roofs. We leave the
monastery Tugden on our left; a little farther, at the foot
of a mountain spur, Muhamed Isa had made a halt. About
a hundred Tibetans of all ages and both sexes, exceedingly
black and dirty, but very friendly, surrounded the tents.
They sold us sheep, fowls, milk, radishes, and malt beer
(<i>chang</i>), and our tired animals were supplied with plenty of
hay and barley. Women with a round arch on their necks
by way of ornament, carried wicker baskets of dung to the
fires, and were never tired of sitting with us, astonished at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
us and our wonderful occupations. Here Ngurbu Tundup
presented himself and gave me the welcome information
that his master, Kung Gushuk, would forward my correspondence.
He received only a part of his reward at
present, and the remainder would be paid him as soon as I
had news that the letters had actually reached Gyangtse.
He handed me a <i>kadakh</i>, or cloth of welcome, from his
master, and said that he was ordered to accompany us and
assist us on the way to Shigatse. This was most important
news. It signified that we should meet with no
obstructions.</p>

<p>Here the absolute height was 12,956 feet, and the air was
warm and pleasant. At nine o&rsquo;clock we had only 5½ degrees
of frost, and therefore the tent flap was left open. I held
a long consultation with Robert and Muhamed Isa. Should
we spend ten days instead of only one in this delightful
locality, where there was all we wanted and where the
animals could recover their strength, while I visited the
curious monasteries perched like storks&rsquo; nests on rocky
promontories, or glittering white at the mouths of
valleys? No; we knew nothing definite about the reception
that awaited us; it was only eleven days&rsquo; journey to
Lhasa, and we could reach our destination, Shigatse, in
three days. We had heard nothing from the Government,
but we were expected in Shigatse. Any moment might
bring a change unfavourable to us. We would not therefore
lose a single precious day, but would start early in the
morning, and hurry on as long as the road was open to us.</p>

<p>Our excitement was becoming acute. After all the
severe trials and adventures we had experienced should we
succeed in reaching our goal? At night the Ladakis sang
their Tashi-lunpo hymn more softly and earnestly than
ever. At midnight they were singing still, and I listened
attentively, though I had so frequently heard the song on
the Chang-tang.</p>

<p>Then the fires went out in our first camp in the valley of
the Brahmaputra. The crowd collected before the tents on
the morning of the 7th was a very mixed one. Horses,
mules, and cows were to carry the luggage, for there were
no yaks here. A south-west storm blew when I started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
fully an hour later, and the whole population of the
neighbourhood collected to witness our departure. Just
as I was mounting into the saddle three emissaries
appeared from a certain Cheppa Deva, a friend of Kung
Gushuk. They brought me a present from him consisting
of a whole slaughtered sheep, a thick sweet cake, with
figures in relief and preserved fruits on the top, three large
lumps of butter, and thirty eggs. I could not send any
present in return, for the caravan was already gone on, but
I gave them 15 bright rupees and begged them to convey
my hearty greeting to the unknown Cheppa Deva. Then
the chief of the three said: &ldquo;We must hand over this
money to our master, and therefore it would be well if the
Bombo Chimbo would give us an extra tip.&rdquo; This was a
cute, sensible speech; they received an additional sum of
money and went away contented.</p>

<p>A number of other people accompanied us, giggling
and chattering, as far as the highroad to Shigatse. The
attractive monasteries on the right and left of the road
passed out of sight, and we rode through part of the village
Dzundi, inhabited by smiths, and past a warm medicinal
spring, over which a bath-house is erected&mdash;unfortunately
it was just then occupied by a patient, and we could not
enter; white clouds of steam issued through the roof,
windows, and doors. And further proceeds our picturesque
party, through more villages and barley-fields, past fresh
monasteries, rocky cliffs and valley openings, till the road
winds over a barren plain more and more to the south,
towards the Brahmaputra, just as one approaches the
Indus from Leh, and, as there, loose stones have been
removed from the road and lie along the sides.</p>

<p>Where the valley contracts we have the large monastery
Tarting-gompa on its rock to the left, and on the
right or southern bank of the river the village Rokdso
with its ferry; and now we reach the first granitic spur,
which extends to the neighbourhood of the river. Beyond
the village Karu with its cornfields and small gardens we
ride through a hollow way 13 feet deep, a corridor in the
yellow löss; here and there the banks are broken through
by rain gutters, and through the gaps, as from the windows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
of a gallery, we have a glimpse of the great side valley So,
which drains from the south into the Tsangpo. The rain
has modelled the loam into pyramids, sometimes as much
as a yard high, like a forest of gigantic mushrooms. We
meet dark bare-headed peasants, driving before them laden
horses and mules, and women and children with baskets on
their backs, containing fuel or roots. An old woman sat
astride on her mule and rose in her saddle with the step
of the animal; a man of higher position, on horseback,
accompanied his wife; some country people whistled as
they followed their cows laden with hay; a party of men
and women in picturesque costumes of blue, red, and yellow
were making a pilgrimage to the New Year&rsquo;s festivities in
Tashi-lunpo, which my Ladakis had long hoped to attend.
All the traffic was making eastwards, and we met only men
who were going on business from one village to another.</p>

<p>The road now runs over low land which is flooded in
summer, so that those who pass this way are then obliged
to travel along the flanks of the mountains. Even now
the Tsangpo is an imposing stream, and we rest for a while
on its bank, which our road touches for the first time. For
the first time in my life I drink of the holy water of the
Brahmaputra. Bluish-green and almost perfectly transparent,
it flows slowly and noiselessly in a single bed to
the east, while here and there fishes are seen rising.
Only a very thin crust of ice confines the water at the
margin, but a bright clump of ice, like a mountain crystal,
frequently sweeps past us. A raft laden with barley floats
down on the way to the great market in Shigatse, and soon
vanishes round the next corner, where the steersmen with
their long poles must keep a good look-out&mdash;a sight
reminding me vividly of my voyage on the Tarim in the
year 1899.</p>

<p>To the east of this point the soil is sandy and rises into
barren dunes 6 feet high. One can tell at the first glance
how they are formed, especially on a day like this, when the
westerly storm sweeps the drift-sand before it in clouds,
often hiding completely the steep rocky walls on the right
bank of the river. During high-water the river deposits
quantities of mud and sand on the shallows, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
exposed and dry up in winter. The west wind carries
away the silted material to pile up dunes farther east;
where these lie low enough, the next high-water clears
them away, and when it has fallen the process is repeated.
Thus in the valley of the Tsangpo a continuous displacement
of solid matter from west to east is going on. It is
not alone that the river excavates the bed with its own
weight, and loads its water with masses of mud; but also
the material deposited at the banks is borne away by the
wind which comes to the help of the water. Wind and
flowing water work together in harmony to the same end,
washing out this gigantic drainage channel deeper and
deeper. They have laboured at the work for untold thousands
of years, and the result is the Tsangpo valley as we
see it to-day.</p>

<p>After a ride of eight hours we came to a small village
composed of thirty houses, called Rungma (Illustration 104),
where the tents were set up in a garden among poplars and
willows. How pleasant it seemed to us, who had passed a
whole half-year on the desolate Chang-tang plateau, to
hear the wind soughing again through the leafless branches
of the trees! Now the fires were no longer fed with dried
dung; dry faggots crackled between the tents and threw a
bright light on the trees and the Tibetans.</p>

<p>On February 8 we had another long ride. Ngurbu
Tundup complained that his mule had run away, so that
he must stay behind, and begged me to pay him the remainder
of the reward I had promised. But this trick
was too transparent.</p>

<p>We suspected that the letters had not reached Gyangtse
after all. However, we were not far from the village when
Ngurbu came riding after us on a borrowed horse with
jingling bells. When we had pitched our camp, Ngurbu
was immediately sent off as a punishment to Shigatse, to
inform Kung Gushuk that we should arrive the next day,
and that I wished to have a good house prepared for me.
That was a thoughtless step, for if Kung Gushuk had told
what he knew to a Chinaman, we should have been stopped
at the last moment before reaching the town.</p>

<p>The winding highway runs further and further eastwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
along the northern bank of the Tsangpo, past fields
laid out in terraces and watered by the river. It is
astonishing to find in Tibet so much cultivable land, and
such a number of inhabited villages with solid stone houses
and gardens.</p>

<p>At Lamo-tang the river washes the mountainous foot
of the left bank, and here a narrow break-neck path runs
in zigzags up the slopes. But it need not be used except
when the water is high. Now we travel along the embankment
beside the river. The river has quite a different
appearance to-day: its surface is half covered with porous
ice-blocks, but then at night there were 33.8 degrees of frost.
Leaping and clattering they drive downstream and graze
the fringe of ice attached to the bank, piling up on it small
white walls of ice. They keep in the line of the strongest
current, and often remain stranded on sandbanks which
show a reddish-brown tinge amid the clear green water.
A grand landscape under a blue sky and among ponderous
fissured mountain masses! In the afternoon the drift-ice
had decreased in quantity, and in the evening, before our
camp, had disappeared altogether (Illustration 101).</p>

<p>Upwards over the extreme point of a rocky projection
by a stony staircase where we prefer to go on foot. Then
we descend again to the level valley-bottom, past more
villages and monasteries, always surrounded by <i>chhortens</i>
and <i>manis</i>, and often, like the Tikze-gompa in Ladak,
perched on rocks. Tanak-puchu is a great valley coming
down from the north, and its river irrigates the fields in
Tanak. I could not obtain a clear description of this
valley: all I heard was that it came from a pass to the
north; so I do not know whether it comes from the
Trans-Himalaya, like the My-chu and Shang-chu valleys.
If such is the case, however, then the eastern watershed of
the My-chu is a hydrographic boundary between it and the
Tanak-puchu, not the Shang-chu. The question can only
be solved by future investigations on the spot.</p>

<p>In the Tanak (&ldquo;The Black Horse&rdquo;) valley we encamped
in a pretty garden (Illustration 105), where a small house
with a gaily painted verandah is occupied by the Tashi
Lama, when the prelate pays his annual visit to the temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
Tashi-gembe. The garden is situated on a terrace of
detritus, which descends sheer down to the river and affords
a magnificent view of the Tsangpo. The river is here
called Sangchen, or sometimes Tsangpo-Chimbo, that is,
the great river. The Tsangpo is the river of Tibet <i>par
excellence</i>. According to Waddell this name is sometimes
so written that it is a strict translation of the name Brahmaputra,
which means &ldquo;Son of Brahma.&rdquo; We have already
mentioned the name Yere-tsangpo, and farther westwards
we shall meet with other names. In the lower part of its
passage through the Himalayas it is called Dihong, and it
assumes the name of Brahmaputra only when it emerges
from the mountains to water the plains of Assam.</p>

<p class="center chap2">DOWN THE TSANGPO BY BOAT&mdash;ENTRY INTO SHIGATSE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> 9th of February dawned, the great day on which our
caravan of yearning pilgrims would reach the goal of their
dreams. The day before had been stormy, and in the
evening a strange reddish-yellow light spread over the
valley in consequence of the dust that floated about in
the air; the mountains were indistinct, and the horizon to
the east was quite invisible. But the morning was beautiful
and the day was calm. Early in the morning Sonam
Tsering and some Ladakis went on board two boats with
part of the baggage, while Muhamed Isa and Tsering kept
along the road with the caravan. That was a stratagem
we had devised. If any one appeared at the last moment
ordering us to halt, the prohibition would only affect
Muhamed Isa and the caravan, while I should slip into
Shigatse by water unnoticed.</p>

<p>All the others were on the way when Robert, Rabsang,
and I made our way from the terrace down a steep gully,
and stepped on board the excellent boat that was to bear
us down the holy stream. These Tsangpo boats are both
simple and practical. A skeleton, or rather framework, of
thin tough boughs and laths is tied fast together, and is
covered with four yak hides sewed together, which are
attached to a rim of wood forming the gunwale&mdash;and the
boat is ready. It is very dumpy, of a long rectangular
shape, but somewhat smaller in front than behind. It is
not heavy, being only an ordinary load for a man. All
the boats now descending the river with pilgrims going
to the New Year festival, and the boats which convey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
country produce or fuel to Shigatse and Tashi-lunpo, will
be carried back by the owners along the river-bank. A
large proportion of the inhabitants of Hlindug-ling, the
part of Tanak where we had encamped, gain their living
by such transport. These boats are very buoyant; there
were four men in mine, and it could have borne a much
heavier load.</p>

<p>The rower sits on a thin board and rows continuously,
but faces forwards, for he must be able to see the waterway
downstream. The blades of the oars are divided like a
fork, and a piece of leather is sewed between the prongs
like the web of a duck&rsquo;s foot. Our boatman is a self-confident
fellow, and receives my advice with a smile of
superiority when I venture to air my experience in river
navigation. The current does most of the work, but the
oars are in constant use to keep the boat under control.</p>

<p>At first we glided along slowly till we came to the
village Segre, with white, clean, and neat houses standing
picturesquely on the left bank, and a short distance beyond,
to where the river washes the foot of a steep mountain
spur. But then the velocity of the boat increased, amounting
on an average to 4 feet a second. I was able to
look down the river, note the intervals of time, take my
bearings, measure the velocity, and draw a map of the
river&rsquo;s course, just as I had before done on the Tarim.
We passed no cataracts, but the water formed small rapids
in narrow contracted reaches, and seethed round the bends.
It was a splendid voyage, the most delightful that I have
experienced. The last day&rsquo;s journey could not have
passed more pleasantly. In Tibet, where hitherto Nature
had only placed obstacles in our way, we were now borne
along by one of Nature&rsquo;s forces. During half a year we had
worked our way through Chang-tang with constant losses,
and now the gates stood wide open and I glided as
smoothly as on oil to my destination. One of the greatest
erosion valleys of the world displayed its wonderful panorama,
the air was so still that not the slightest ripple
ruffled the surface of the Tsangpo. Undisturbed by the
winds of heaven, the emerald-green water gives itself up to
the sport of silent eddies, which, coming into existence at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
cliffs and projecting points, dance rapidly downstream in
ever wider circles, and finally vanish altogether. They are
born and die, come and go, and the same tongue of land
calls forth new ones to life, but every new vortex whirls its
spirals in other water of the holy river, which has for
thousands of years pursued its course to the mysterious
narrows of the Dihong.</p>

<p>What an intoxicating pleasure to be borne along eastwards
by the Tsangpo! Is the river one of the forbidden
paths of Tibet? If they come now and stop me I shall
return: &ldquo;I am not in Tibet; I am on the holy river of the
Hindus; let me alone.&rdquo; The view changes with quite perplexing
frequency: we have a dark wall of rock in front of
us; at the next turn it has disappeared, and another comes
into sight on the opposite side of the stream. We often
wonder what above and below mean here; we seem to
remain motionless while the panorama revolves round us.
Robert is plunged in thought, looks over the gunwale, and,
misled by the water and ice-blocks about us, exclaims with
astonishment: &ldquo;Why, Master, surely we are not moving.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look at the sandbank yonder on the left,&rdquo; I reply, and
he is puzzled at seeing it move upstream. And where the
river is shallow and the bottom can be seen, it seems as
though the gravel, rounded stones, and sandbanks were all
passing upwards underneath the boat.</p>

<p>We fall into reverie on this fairy-like voyage. A
thought occurs to me: shall we travel on to the mouth of
the Ki-chu and thence go up to Lhasa on foot? We can
travel by night, and hide ourselves during the day; and
Tibetan is Rabsang&rsquo;s mother-tongue. But it passes away
as quickly as the eddies beside the boat. In Lhasa I
could add nothing to the knowledge acquired by Younghusband&rsquo;s
expedition two years before; my hopes were
fixed on the friendship of the Tashi Lama. On the Sela-la
I had conceived a great fancy for the Trans-Himalaya,
and no geographical problem on earth had greater
attractions for me. All my future enterprises should
have the object of making as thorough a scientific
investigation of the Trans-Himalaya as could possibly be
accomplished by one man in a single journey. Yes, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
task was so tremendous that my former longing for Lhasa
died away like the red of even in the Tsangpo valley, this
gigantic colonnade of granite, this royal highway of Buddha,
which, breaking through the mountains and becoming hazy
in the far east, leads direct to the mouth of the Lhasa
valley, while we now glide along on its floor of liquid
emerald to the holiest town of Lamaism. Fascinating and
attractive as fairy dances the current carried my thoughts
eastwards, but it also prompted new plans of campaign in
districts which had hitherto lain outside my sphere of
interest. In the valleys which pour their water to the
My-chu, I had heard more than once of Nain Sing&rsquo;s Raga-tsangpo,
which some Tibetans had described as quite as
important as the Tsangpo itself. Was, perhaps, the Raga-tsangpo
the main stream? Had it, perchance, tributaries
deriving their water from the heart of the mysterious
country to the north? Not an evening had passed during
the whole winter when I had not studied attentively
Ryder&rsquo;s and Nain Sing&rsquo;s maps. Was it certain where
the source of the Brahmaputra lay? Had I not here a
task before me much more profitable than following in
the steps of Tommy Atkins to Lhasa? The sun-lighted
waters bearing our boat brought me intelligible messages
from distant ravines, from the melting margins of perpetual
fields of firn, from bluish glaciers and green ice grottoes in
the heaven-kissing crest of the Himalayas, nay, a sonorous
echo from the valley where the source of the Brahmaputra
bursts out from the rock.</p>

<p>But we must not forget the demands of the present
amid dreams of the future. The golden gods of Tashi-lunpo
expect us at their festival. Sometimes the river
contracts and deepens, and the bottom ceases to be visible,
sometimes it spreads out and the velocity decreases.
Below the village Pani, where a valley opens out, the
river makes a bend to the south-east, but quickly turns
eastwards again, where it traverses the great bed which
in summer lays almost the whole breadth of the valley
bottom under water. We seldom pass a high, clearly
defined bank covered with grass, which is not flooded
at high-water. From time to time the river sends out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
a side channel, which, however, soon rejoins the main bed.
Wild-geese stand on the bank and scream as we pass by;
black and white ducks, herons and other waterfowl, are
fearless and trustful, as though they well knew that it is
strictly forbidden in Tashi-lunpo to quench the light of life
in any living thing.</p>

<p>Just as we were leaving Tanak a dozen boats passed
the village; some were tied together in couples so that
they could not capsize. The passengers were pilgrims
from farther up the river on their way to the New Year
festival. There women sat in their most elegant holiday
attire, with necklets of coloured glass beads from which
little silver boxes containing images and relics or silver
coins were suspended, and with high arched frames at the
back of the neck covered with red woollen material and
adorned with turquoise and coral. There sat greybeards,
men, and boys, and a couple of lamas in their red togas
had joined the party of laymen. Most of the boats carried
small prayer streamers on rods tied to the gunwale, and
small reliquaries hung over it to bring a blessing on
the boat journey. In some boats sand was laid on the
bottom and slabs of stone, where a fire could be kindled and
tea infused. They took little notice of us, but talked and
gossiped continually and seemed very merry. Evidently
the passengers of some boats were well known to one
another, and were travelling together from the same
village. All the boats on the river were engaged on a
day like this, and a continuous succession of pilgrims
streamed down the water highway to the holy monastery.
Where the banks were low these small black points could
be seen both up and down stream (Illustrations 106, 107).</p>

<p>We float past a sandbank, where some blocks of ice
are stranded, warning us of danger. The boat only twice
grazes the bottom, for our boatman is watchful and steers
well. He knows the way, too, and here it is not so easy as
it looks to find the course; for the river splits into arms,
and only a boatman acquainted with them all can choose
the best and shortest. Sometimes he guides us into a
narrow channel where the water rushes swiftly.</p>

<p>Now the river turns towards the right, southern side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
the valley, where a mountain falls sheer to the water,
leaving only sufficient room on the bank for a road buttressed
up with stone blocks. There a dozen boatmen
are carrying their skin boats on their backs, and, seen from
behind, resemble a row of gigantic beetles. And in the
other direction caravans of mules laden with firewood are
being driven to Shigatse. Here begins a succession of
views of inconceivable grandeur, picturesqueness, and
wildness. One cliff after another falls steeply to the river,
and is washed by the water murmuring at its foot. Often
a block of ice is tilted up in a whirlpool, rises above the
surface, brightly glistening in the sun, and then falls back
again.</p>

<p>We waited for an opportunity of landing, but the current
was too strong. At length the boatman succeeded in
getting us into a backwater, and I got out on to a promontory
just as a party of pilgrims were passing by, and
was in time to take them with my camera. They could
not make out what I was doing, and they ceased talking;
they seemed relieved, and breathed freely again, when they
found that they had got off with a whole skin, and that my
camera was not a firearm. Wherever I turned my eyes
new subjects presented themselves and invited me to stay
sketching all day long. But there was no time; it was my
last day, and I had ventured on too great a game to let
everything depend on a single card. &ldquo;It is still far,&rdquo; the
skipper said, pointing at starting to a point behind which lay
the Shigatse valley, a considerable distance off (Illustration 103).</p>

<p>When we come again into the middle of the valley the
river becomes as broad as a lake, is smooth as a mirror,
grand and majestic, flows slowly as oil, and reflects the
forms of the mountains and the boat. The spurs and cliffs
of the mountains on the northern bank have a rosy hue, the
water, usually green, shines blue from the reflexion of the
sky, and all is solemnly quiet and peaceful. Robert and
Rabsang sleep in a corner, but I grudge to lose a minute
of this pilgrim voyage. Here and there stands a cairn with
a streamer-decked rod&mdash;these are the places where routes
cross the river. At one ferry a large caravan of yaks were
halting, and their loads of sheep&rsquo;s wool were piled up in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
wall on the bank. The black men stood out sharply against
a background of yellow sand dunes. Farther down Tsering
was engaged in getting his detachment into a boat, while
his horses were being driven on to another by coaxing and
scolding. Here the great road from Tanak crosses the
river, and Tsering shouted to us as we shot rapidly past
that Muhamed Isa was far ahead. Fishermen in two boats
were at work with their net in a bay of the river, trying to
drive the fish into the net by throwing stones; they had a
poor catch, but promised to bring us fish for sale in the
morning to Shigatse. We again make a bend to the south-east
and approach the mountains of the southern side, at
the foot of which we pass the villages Chang-dang, Tashi-gang,
and Tang-gang, prettily situated among gardens.
The river now flows slowly in a single channel, as though
it must be careful in passing the mouth of a valley leading
to a monastery.</p>

<p>There is much life and movement at the foot of the next
promontory; many boats laden with barley, straw, firewood,
and dung are on the point of putting in, and from others
the cargo is being cleared amid shouts and singing. Rows
of boats are drawn ashore, and lie turned upside down like
large hairy toads. The boatman who has conveyed us to
the mouth of the Nyang valley receives four times the
usual pay, and can scarcely believe his eyes. He will be
able to give himself a day&rsquo;s rest to-morrow.</p>

<p>At this singular landing-stage Guffaru is waiting with
our horses. I mount my small white Ladak horse and
Robert his Tibetan bay, and while the sun is setting we
ride up the Nyang valley with Rabsang as outrider. We
soon plunge into a labyrinth of hollow ways and fissures
in yellow loam. But we do not need a guide, for several
travellers and mule-drivers are on their way, and give us
instructions, and none is uncivil. A little to the left of
our road flows the Nyang-chu, the river of Gyangtse, one
of the largest southern tributaries of the Tsangpo, with
several villages on its banks. Twilight falls; I feel my
heart beating; shall we succeed? It becomes dark; a
large white <i>chhorten</i> stands like a ghost close on the right
of our way. Rabsang asks a belated wanderer how far it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
is, and receives the answer: &ldquo;Follow the road and you will
come soon to a lane.&rdquo; On the right rises a hill, and on its
summit the outlines of the Shigatse-dzong, the Council
House, are faintly seen against the sky. Now we are
between white houses and follow a narrow lane, in which
it is still darker. In an open place some Chinese stand
and stare at us. Snappy dogs come out of the houses and
bark at us. Otherwise the town is asleep, and no popular
assembly witnesses our entry. But where are our men?
We do not know where they are quartered. Ah! there stands
Namgyal, waiting to show us the way, and he leads
us to a gate in the wall behind which Kung Gushuk&rsquo;s
garden lies.</p>

<p>Here Muhamed Isa and all the other men meet and
greet us, as though they would offer me their congratulations
on a great triumph. We dismount, and cross the court
to the house which Kung Gushuk has placed at my
disposal. But it is cold and cheerless, and I prefer my
tent set up under the poplars of the garden. While we are
waiting for Tsering we sit by a large fire of brushwood,
whither also several Tibetans gradually gather. I pay
no heed to them; I am too much engaged with my own
thoughts. I had been fortunate, and after a six months&rsquo;
journey through Tibet had reached my first goal. It
was late at night when my dinner was ready; it was very
welcome, for we had had no provisions on the boat. Then
I had two hours&rsquo; good work at the notes I had made during
the day. But I was disturbed by a gentleman who belonged
to the secular staff of the Tashi Lama. He said that
he was not acting upon orders, but that he had been told
that an unusual visitor had arrived, and he begged me to
furnish him with particulars. Then he wrote down the
names and nationality of us all, and the size of the caravan,
and inquired by which way we had come, whither we intended
to travel, and what was the object of my visit to
Shigatse. He was exceedingly polite, and hoped that we
had not suffered too severely in the cold of Chang-tang.
He was, he said, an official of too low a rank to venture to
address the Tashi Lama, but he would communicate the
information he had obtained to his superiors. I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
heard anything more of him. Seldom have I slept so well
as on this night&mdash;yes, perhaps, when I had fortunately
completed my college course.</p>

<p>When the next day passed without any one, lay or
spiritual, giving himself the least trouble about us, I sent
Muhamed Isa up to Tashi-lunpo. Its golden roofs shone
fierily in the rays of the evening sun on a slope in the west
close to our garden, which was situated in the southern
suburb of Shigatse. My excellent caravan leader sought
out a lama of high position, who answered that he would
send some one next day to inquire particularly about
my intentions and he would then communicate with me
further. At the same moment a Chinaman of high rank
named Ma paid me a visit. He introduced himself as the
commander of the <i>lansa</i>, or detachment of 140 Chinese
soldiers, which, it seems, garrisons Shigatse. Ma, who was a
Dungan and a follower of Islam, became my particular friend
from the first moment, and smirked with good temper and
cheerfulness. He had arrived from Lhasa five days previously,
and was to stay until the Amban, the Governor-General,
Lien Darin, recalled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is inconceivable,&rdquo; said Ma, &ldquo;how you have contrived
to get through to Shigatse without being stopped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to speak frankly, I had expected all kinds of annoyances,
if not sooner, at any rate a couple of days&rsquo; journey
from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not hear a word of your coming; if I had known
that you were approaching the town, it would have been
my duty to stop you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is fortunate for me that you are strange here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the worst is, that I shall come off badly
as soon as the Amban hears that you are living here,
in Shigatse. But now it is too late; I cannot help it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Ma Daloi, do you think that the Tashi Lama
will receive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Immediately on my arrival I begged for
an audience with the Grand Lama, but he has not even
condescended to give me an answer. And yet I am a
Chinese officer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was little encouraging to me, a stranger, who had
come from the north without permission, and of whom
no one knew what spirit he was. And then next day was
the New Year festival, which I could not attend without
some understanding, especially as the Tashi Lama himself
would be present. But he must know something about me,
or how could Ngurbu Tundup&rsquo;s arrival at Ngangtse-tso
with the letters be explained?</p>

<p>Meanwhile we awaited the course of events, and went
out with a paper lantern to inspect one of the horses which
had died in his stall and must be removed. Why could he
not remain alive now, when the mangers were so full of
barley, straw, and chaff, and the animals stood against a
wall which sheltered them from cold and wind, and had an
idle time before them? Five of the veterans and the last
mule from Poonch were still living, the last six of the splendid
caravan which had set out from Leh six months before.
All the rest lay in Chang-tang and the storms roared
above them. These six should be cherished as the apple
of my eye and be well cared for. Their sore backs should
be washed and rubbed, their flanks groomed, at night they
should sleep in cloths, and of barley and chaff they should
have abundance. The ground beneath them should be
strewn with straw, and they should be led to water at
regular times. I stroked my small grey, but he bit and
kicked as usual. He, of all the veterans, was in the best
condition, and Guffaru declared that he could cross the
Chang-tang again if necessary.</p>

<p>We were very comfortable in the garden. To right
and left of my tent stood Robert&rsquo;s and Muhamed Isa&rsquo;s, and
that of the Ladakis a little farther off, and huge fires burned
as usual before the latter two. A man and woman of Kung
Gushuk&rsquo;s household lived in a wretched hut in the entrance
gate, and procured for us anything we wanted. The woman
was old and infirm, and her face was bedaubed with black,
but she was exceedingly friendly. She was always coming
to my tent, bowing, giggling and grinning out of pure goodwill.</p>

<p>On February 11 I was awaked at half-past six with the
news that two men wished to speak to me at once. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
brazier and warm water were brought, I dressed in great
haste, the tent was swept and put in order, and then I sent
to invite my guests to enter. The one was a tall lama of
high rank, named Lobsang Tsering, and he was a secretary
of the Tashi Lama; the other, Duan Suen, was a Chinaman,
with handsome and refined features. Both were
extremely polite and had polished manners. We talked for
two hours on all kinds of subjects. Singularly enough, my
arrival in Shigatse seemed to be a complete surprise to
both gentlemen. They inquired my name, the route by
which I had come, and my intentions, and, of course,
had never heard of poor little Sweden; but they wrote
down the Swedish, English, and Chinese names of my
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to be present to-day at the New Year
festival,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I cannot leave Shigatse without witnessing
one of the greatest church feasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A European has never attended our festivals, which
are intended only for Tibetans and pilgrims of our faith,
and permission will never be granted to witness them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panchen Rinpoche (the Holy Teacher, the Tashi
Lama) must have been informed of my coming some months
ago. His Holiness also knew from which direction I should
come, or he could not have sent my mails to the Dangra-yum-tso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Panchen Rinpoche never meddles with worldly
matters; these are looked after by his brother, the Duke
(Kung Gushuk).&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, I must see His Holiness, for I know that he
expects me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is vouchsafed only to a small number of mortals to
appear before the face of the Holy One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the letter of the Raja of Stok and the Chinese
passport came into my mind. The letter made no impression
on them; but the young Chinaman, when the
passport with its blue border and red stamp was unfolded
before him, became very interested, and opened his eyes
wider the farther he read. He read it once through, and
then translated it slowly to Lobsang Tsering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; they then both asked, &ldquo;did you not show us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
this paper at once? It would have saved us all discussion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the passport is made out for Eastern Turkestan
and not for Tibet,&rdquo; I answered truthfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That does not matter, now that you are here. You
have an excellent Chinese passport, and therefore are under
Chinese protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Chinaman took the passport and went off
with it, while Mr. Lobsang Tsering put further questions
to me and examined our weapons and other articles. At
last I asked him whether he would like to see our garden,
and I hurriedly ate my breakfast during his absence. Then
the Chinaman came back and declared shortly that I might
attend the festival, that especial seats were reserved for
myself and a couple of my people, and that a chamberlain of
the Tashi Lama&rsquo;s court would call for us at the proper time.
Now I blessed the Chinese passport which had caused me
so much vexation at the time, and I blessed the Indian
Government which had forced me to procure it; I blessed
Count Wrangel, who had obtained it so quickly, and I
blessed the Chinese ambassador in London, who had
written out the passport with permission of his Government.
But I had never dreamed that it would be of the
slightest use to me, being issued for another country than
Tibet.</p>

<p>This was our entry into Shigatse, and these were our
first experiences there. Not a finger had been raised to
stop us, no inquisitive people had jostled us in the streets
to gaze at us. But now, when we had already set up house
in the town, our presence in the place excited as general
astonishment as if we had dropped down straight from
heaven. That this stroke had succeeded, and through no
action of mine, was due to certain peculiar circumstances.
Hlaje Tsering had himself for some unexplained reason
reopened the bag in which he had caught us, and the
chieftains dwelling south of the Ngangtse-tso probably
thought: &ldquo;If the Governor of Naktsang lets them pass,
we cannot stop them.&rdquo; It was also lucky for us that some
of these chiefs had betaken themselves to the New Year
festival at Tashi-lunpo, and that we ourselves were lost in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
the crowd of other pilgrims when we came to the great
highway; for during the days of the New Year the Tibetans
are like capercailzies at breeding time: they neither
see nor hear. And, lastly, I, the only European of the
caravan, had ridden into the town when night had already
spread a veil of darkness over the earth.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXIV</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE NEW YEAR FESTIVAL</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> Lamaist Church has, in addition to the monthly
festivals, four great annual ceremonies, and the greatest
is the New Year feast, the Losar, which is celebrated
in remembrance of the Sakya-muni, Buddha&rsquo;s victory
over the six heresies, the victory of the true religion over
infidelity. It is always held at the beginning of February,
and is therefore a festival of spring and light, in which the
children of Buddha welcome the victory of the lengthening
days over the darkness of winter, the passing away of
the cold weather, the awakening of life and of the sprouting
seeds after the winter sleep, and the approach of
spring, when mild breezes, heralds of a warmer, brighter
season, play with the streamers on all the temple roofs.
The Losar is therefore an extraordinarily popular feast,
which for quite fifteen days draws the labourer from his
work, the herdsman from his yaks, and the merchant from
his counter; a season of joy and pleasure, of feasting and
dancing; a time for paying and receiving visits, and of
giving and receiving presents; when the houses and temples
are swept and garnished, and the best clothes and ornaments
are taken out of the trunks; when friends gather to
drink together in their apartments, and then in humble
meditation squash their noses against the floor before the
images in the dark temple halls; when broad anecdotes and
strange stories of robbers are related to visitors from a
distance, frequently interrupted by the hum of the prayer
mills and the eternal truth &ldquo;Om mani padme hum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All are admitted to the great temple festivals: no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
distinction is made between clergy and laity, monks and
nomads, rich and poor, men and women, greybeards and
children. A begging woman clothed in rags is seen beside
a duchess loaded with precious stones. The Losar is a
feast of the whole people, a carnival of Lamaism, like the
Lupercalia and Saturnalia in ancient Rome.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to arrive just in time for the greatest
annual festival of Lamaism, and to be present at its
celebration in the monastery town of Tashi-lunpo. At
half-past ten appeared Tsaktserkan, a young chamberlain
from the vatican, in a very elegant yellow robe of silk and
a hat like an upturned dish, with a hanging tassel, and
announced that he had come from His Holiness to fetch
me to the festival, and that he was commissioned by the
lama Lobsang Tsering to attend on me during my sojourn
in Shigatse. He requested me to put on the finest clothes
I had with me, for I should sit where I could be seen
during the whole time from the seat of the Grand Lama.
At the bottom of my box I had an old dress coat, several
dress shirts, and patent leather shoes, which I had brought
especially for the benefit of the Tashi Lama, and when
Robert had rummaged out my shaving implements from
another box, I assumed the appearance of a European
gentleman among the bare mountains of Tibet. But I
could not compare in gorgeousness with my interpreter
Muhamed Isa, for his gold-embroidered turban surpassed
everything. Of the rest only Robert, Tsering, Rabsang,
and Namgyal were allowed to accompany me.</p>

<p>We mount the new horses from the Ngangtse-tso
and ride to the monastery, a distance of twelve minutes.
We leave on the right the Shigatse-dzong, which stands
picturesquely on its hill in the sunshine, and reminds me of
the palace at Leh. Our way passes across an open place,
by detached houses and courtyards, fields, pools, and
ditches; the crowd increases, the road becomes narrower;
people stream in dense masses to the monastery&mdash;townsmen
and nomads, pilgrims from distant lands and dirty ragged
beggars; and old women sit at every corner offering with
loud voice sweetmeats and cakes for sale. Boys, dogs, and
Chinamen are all mingled together as in a huge ant-heap.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
But Tsaktserkan and his marshals open a way for us and
we ride up the lane, beside which rows of great upright
prayer mills are enclosed in white-washed masonry. A
little higher the way becomes a proper street with tall
white houses containing the cells of the monks, and we
dismount at one of the chief entrances, a large gateway.
High above us rises a brick-red temple building, the
Tsogla-kang, and above all shines the white façade of the
Labrang with a black frieze on the top and with awnings
before its windows. We admire the imposing singular
architecture, visible in all its lines and details and making
an impression of uniformity and solidity. It is, perhaps,
owing to my affection for Tibet that everything in this
wonderful land is bewitching and magnificent in my eyes.</p>

<p>Now we mount up to the holy dwellings; the steep,
corridor-like passages between the mysterious walls are
paved with flagstones, varying in form and dimensions, but
all smooth and bright as metal, though very uneven and
worn, for they have been trodden for centuries by the feet
of innumerable pilgrims and the soles of hurrying monks.
Sometimes the crowding in this tightly packed stream of
pilgrims is very uncomfortable, and in the lanes there is a
musty odour of human beings. We mount higher and
higher, go along winding passages, turn frequently at right
angles left or right, pass through a gateway roofed over
and with a massive threshold, and follow passages and
corridors, dimly lighted, dark or pitch-dark, crowded with
lamas in red togas, who have one or both arms bare,
closely cropped hair, and no covering on their heads.
They welcome us with kindly good-tempered smiles, and
then move aside to let us pass. Where treacherous steps
lurk in the darkness, I feel a strong arm ready to support
me in case I stumble; it is some attentive lama at my
elbow.</p>

<p>Now it becomes lighter in the monastery walks, and the
profiles of the monks stand out black against the light.
We enter a gallery with massive wooden pillars, and we
take our places in a balcony shut off from the gallery
by curtains of yak&rsquo;s wool with horizontal white stripes at the
bottom. An arm-chair of European form was placed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
me, and I needed it; for this day&rsquo;s spectacle, the grandest
of the whole New Year festival, lasted three hours. Here
we sat as on the second tier of an open-air theatre, and had
an excellent view of the scene of action, like a rectangular
market-place, and surrounded by open platforms or terraces
supported by colonnades of wooden pillars. The whole
reminded me of a vast roofless auditorium. In the centre
of the paved court rose a tall mast which had suffered
severely from the wind, and had been fissured by many
summers and the frosts of the succeeding winters, and from
its top long flags hung down to the ground. Immediately
below our balcony ran the uppermost terrace, and beyond
its edge we looked down over the whole courtyard where
the religious ceremony was to take place, and over the
galleries opposite and at the sides, one storey above the
court below (Illustration 108).</p>

<p>Everywhere, on all the balconies and roofs, on all the
projections and terraces, even right up under the gilded
roofs curved in the Chinese style of the mortuary chapels,
where departed Grand Lamas sleep, the people swarmed.
From our elevated point of vantage we looked down on a
sea of heads, a conglomeration of human beings, a mosaic
of vivid glaring colours, an exhibition of national costumes,
among which the Tibetan dress was certainly the most
conspicuous, but where the eye lighted on figures hailing
from Bhotan and Sikkim, Nepal and Ladak, while Chinese
merchants, or soldiers and pilgrims from the grassy steppes
of Mongolia, were easily distinguishable. An old lama of
high rank, who had shown us to our places, informed us that
there were more than 6000 spectators present, and this
estimate was below rather than in excess of the truth.
Right in front of the highest platform opposite us sits the
Consul of Nepal, a young lieutenant in a round black cap
with a gold band but no peak. He blows rings from his
cigarette, and is the only one guilty of such a desecration of
the holy place. Behind him sit a number of other Nepalese
and representatives of other Himalayan countries attracted
hither by business affairs or religious zeal. To the left of
them are long rows of men in dresses entirely of red or of
yellow, long kaftans with coloured girdles and sashes round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
the waist, and mushroom-shaped hats, also red or yellow,
which have the circumference of a parasol and are fastened
with a string under the chin; they are officials of different
ranks, are either the city fathers, or are attached to the civil
court of the Lama, or to the administrative bodies of the
province Chang. On the gallery below them sit their wives
and other ladies of rank, quite buried under the most varied
and extraordinary adornments: their dresses are red, green,
and yellow; they wear necklaces and silver pendants, silver
cases inlaid with turquoise, and at the back of the neck tall
white aureoles, thickly set with jewels and other ornaments.
Their coiffures are of various forms: some have a parting
in the middle, and hair, like polished ebony, puffed up at
the sides; others have the hair plaited in a number of thin
switches, which are fixed up and decorated with beads, etc.
There are seated women from Pari and Kamba-dzong,
from Ngari-khorsum in the west and Kham in the east,
and from the black tents on the shores of Tengri-nor.
They remind me of Leksand, Mora, and Vingåker, for
there is life and colour in these female groups. Beauty,
according to European ideas, will be sought in vain, but
many seem agreeable and merry; they are healthy, strongly
and symmetrically built, and evidently are much pleased with
their pretty dresses. But if their relationship to the Venus
de Milo is very remote, they are at any rate women; they
talk and chatter, nibble dried peaches and sweets, blow their
noses with their fingers, and throw glances at their neighbours
which betray their firm conviction that they have
outstripped their sisters in the elegance of their attire.
How very different these ladies are to the women we have
seen in Chang-tang! They do not, indeed, wash themselves
every day, but to-day they have washed their faces
for the festival, and one is astonished to see so many fair
complexions&mdash;quite as fair as with us, with scarcely a tinge
of yellow, and often with a colour on the cheeks as fresh as
an apple.</p>

<p>On the platform under our balcony there are no dignitaries:
there the people sit sociably together, there the
<i>profanum vulgus</i> has its place; there sit country mothers
hushing their crying children, and there stand ragged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
beggars leaning on their sticks, or sit on the ground with
their backs against the wall, while they hum their usual
begging songs, which are lost in the confusion of voices.
Many have brought small cushions, or folded clothes to
make a comfortable seat. In some groups tea is drunk
out of wooden cups, in others acquaintances meet and
lay their heads alternately in one another&rsquo;s laps. Fresh
spectators are constantly coming on to the platforms, and
the crush becomes dreadful. The railing is low, so as not
to hide the view of the scene below. The last-comers have
to look for a place against the house wall, and stand that
they may see over the heads of those seated before them.
Some places right up under the roofs seem rather dangerous,
but the people behave well and with great self-control;
there is no jostling, no fighting for places, no one falls over
the low balustrades, but the greatest harmony and the most
perfect order prevail everywhere (Illustrations 111, 112).</p>

<p>The weather was all that could be desired for an <i>al
fresco</i> festival. What an unpleasant odour must rise from
the crowds of human beings when it rains during a festival
in late summer! Towards the end a slight wind arose,
causing the flags which hung down from the galleries to
unfold and blow out. To-day every one was in a holiday
mood, and little attention was paid to us, though we sat in
the full sunlight in a position where we could be seen
from all sides. Occasionally some one turned towards us
and made a remark which caused merriment among the
others.</p>

<p>As in the two preceding years the New Year festival of
1907 was of a more solemn character than usual, and had
attracted larger bands of pilgrims, for the Dalai Lama had
taken flight when the English advanced to Lhasa, and this
cowardly pope dwelt, misunderstood and despised, in Urga
in Mongolia, after abandoning his country, where all was
in confusion, to the mercy of the invaders. Many a pilgrim,
who would otherwise have gone to Lhasa, now resorted to
Tashi-lunpo in preference, where the Panchen Rinpoche,
the Pope of Chang, had stuck to his post when the country
was in danger. The Chinese had posted up a long proclamation
at all the street-corners in Lhasa, in which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
declared that the Dalai Lama was deposed because he had
exposed his people to danger instead of defending them,
and appointed the Tashi Lama in his place as the highest
administrator of the home affairs of Tibet. True, the mob
had torn down this proclamation and trampled it in the
dust, and the Tashi Lama had refused his acquiescence,
but nevertheless it was still apparent, two and a half years
later, that the Tashi Lama enjoyed a far higher reputation
than the Dalai Lama. For though the Dalai Lama was
supposed to be omnipotent, all-seeing, and omniscient, his
troops had been defeated by infidel strangers; although he
had promised his warriors invulnerability, they had been
shot down like pheasants by the English machine guns;
although he had solemnly sworn that no harm could befall
Lhasa, the abode of the gods, the enemy had occupied
the town, while the invincible one, the almighty, the incarnation
of the deity, had taken to headlong flight like
the most cowardly of marauders, more cowardly and
meaner than the worst mercenary from Kham. The
Tibetans may be forgiven for beginning to doubt the
infallibility of the Dalai Lama after the butchery at Guru
and Tuna, though the priests were ready with plausible
explanations of these events.</p>

<p>The Tashi Lama, on the other hand, had stuck to his
post, and was the object of the reverence and respect
traditionally paid to the chief priests in Tashi-lunpo. He
was the highest prelate in Tibet, while the Pope of Lhasa
was wandering a homeless fugitive about Mongolia. At
the New Year festival of 1907 it was easy to perceive
what great prestige and what boundless confidence were
attached to the person of the Tashi Lama. The crowds
in festive robes who thronged the platforms and balconies
were soon to behold with their own eyes the holiest
of the holy in Tibet. And the nearer the time approached,
the greater became the excitement and expectation. They
had been sitting here for hours, for weeks and months they
had toiled through desolate mountains, and now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly from the uppermost platforms on the roofs
ring out deep, long-drawn-out blasts of horns over the
country; a couple of monks show themselves against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
sky; they blow on singular sea-shells, producing a penetrating
sound, which is echoed back in shrill and yet
heavy tones from the fissured rocks behind the convent;
they summon the <i>Gelugpa</i>, the brotherhood of yellow
monks, to the festival. The venerable lamas whose duty
it is to attend on me, explain everything to me, but I do
not find it easy to follow them, especially as their words
are translated to me by a Mohammedan. They say that
this first blast gives notice that the monks are drinking tea
together. Then a shout of joy bursts forth from the lips
of all the assembled multitude, for now the ceremonies
begin.</p>

<p>On the right hand, on the other side of the court, a
gallery is placed obliquely resting on five pillars, and from
it a stone staircase of eleven steps leads down to the court.
The gallery is now concealed by heavy black curtains
characteristic of all lama monasteries. Invisible choristers,
among whom we seem to distinguish voices of men and
youths, now intone a mystic chant. It is subdued, deep,
and slow; it quavers in religious enthusiasm beneath the
dark vaults of the gallery, and seems to proclaim with
full conviction:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;In every land the whole world round</p>
<p class="i05">This song of praise shall soon resound.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The murmuring voices are silent and the chant swells up
crescendo and then falls again, and seems to die out in some
distant under-world, as though the singers had reached the
portals of Nirvana. Enthralling, mystical, full of yearning
and hope is this wonderful Losar hymn in Tashi-lunpo.
Nothing of the kind I have heard, neither the chanting
in the Isaac Cathedral in St. Petersburg, nor in the
Uspenski Sobor, the cathedral of Moscow, has made a
deeper impression on me; for this chant is grand and
powerful, and yet at the same time soothing as a cradle
song, intoxicating as wine, and sedative as morphia. I
listen to it with a solemn feeling, and miss it when the
murmur of voices begins again, drowning the final notes.</p>

<p>Above this gallery is a second, which is open to the
Dojas-chimbo, as the court is called. Only the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
is covered with a curtain of yellow silk with red stripes,
and with heavy gold fringes and tassels at the bottom.
Behind this curtain the pope takes his place; he is so holy
that his whole person may not be exposed to the gaze of
the multitude, but a small rectangular opening is made in
the curtain that he may be able to watch the proceedings.
After an interval, long copper trumpets give forth a new
signal; the holy one has left the Labrang, and is on his
way to the performance. A procession of high lamas
enters the gallery, each bearing some of the robes and
pontifical insignia of the Tashi Lama. A low, reverential,
and subdued murmur is heard, the multitude rises, on the
tip-toe of expectation, all is still as the grave, and all eyes
are turned towards the door of the gallery through which
the procession enters. He comes, he comes! Then there
is a murmur more reverential than before among the crowd,
who all rise and remain standing, with their bodies bent and
their hands on their knees, inspired with deep devotion at
the approach of the Panchen Rinpoche. He walks slowly
to his place, sits down with crossed legs on a couple of
cushions, and then only his face can be seen through the
opening in the silken curtain. Apparently he is rather
a young man; on his head he wears a large yellow mitre,
which, however, resembles a Roman helmet or a French
infantry helmet; his pontifical robe is of yellow silk, and
in his hand he holds a rosary. At his right hand sits his
younger brother, Kung Gushuk, the Duke, our host, in a
dress of red and yellow, and at the right hand of the latter
we see three other secular lords in yellow. To the left of
the Tashi Lama sits the minister of state, Lobsang Tsundo
Gyamtso, a little fat cardinal with a head like a billiard
ball, and beside him the tutor of the Tashi Lama, Yonsin
Rinpoche, and his deaf and dumb mother Tashi Lamo, a
little woman with a shaven head and a red and yellow dress
embroidered with gold&mdash;I should have taken her for a man
if I had not been told who she was. In the semi-darkness
behind them is a row of high lamas, all in yellow garments&mdash;their
ordinary dress is red. It is truly an imposing scene.
We seem to have before us the whole conclave of venerable
cardinals of Buddhistic catholicism. And this impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
is not weakened by the way in which they move and speak.
One can imagine how softly they speak to one another in
the presence of His Holiness; their movements are dignified
and formal, slowly and gracefully they assume the sitting
posture of Buddha; their gestures are noble; when they
converse, bending slowly towards one another, an air of
genuine striking nobility pervades the whole picture without
the slightest touch of anything that can be called
vulgar.</p>

<p>The crowd has seated itself again, but frequently
pilgrims from far-distant lands stand up embued with
religious awe, bow, fall on their knees, press their foreheads
against the ground, and pay homage to the Grand
Lama as to a god. My eyes frequently meet his; apparently
he is extremely interested in his guests. Before
the commencement of the spectacle he had sent a lama to
my garden to present me with a large <i>kadakh</i>, a long
narrow piece of fine white silk, as a greeting of welcome
and a polite token of esteem. Now several monks came
gently behind my chair; a table, or more correctly a stool,
was set down, and a whole collection of brass bowls were
placed on it, filled to overflowing with the finest mandarin
oranges from Sikkim, dried fruits from Nepal, raisins from
India, figs from Si-ning-fu, sweetmeats from Bhotan, dried
peaches from Baltistan, and Tibetan cakes. And tea-cups
of Chinese porcelain were filled again and again with thick
buttered tea. They said: &ldquo;The Panchen Rinpoche begs
you to partake of these.&rdquo; I immediately caught his eye,
rose and bowed, and he nodded to me with a friendly
smile. All the refreshments left over&mdash;and the quantity
was not small&mdash;were given to my companions.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">118. <span class="sc">View of Tashi-lunpo.</span><br />
Sketch by the Author.</td></tr></table>

<p>Now the religious ceremonies begin. The Tashi
Lama takes off his mitre and hands it to an acolyte. All
the secular lords on the open platforms also take off their
mushroom-shaped hats. Two dancers with gruesome
masks, in coloured silken dresses with wide open sleeves,
come forth from the lower gallery, the curtain being drawn
aside, and revolve in a slow dance over the quadrangle. Then
the Grand Lama is saluted by the eleven principal standards
in Tashi-lunpo; every idol has its standard, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
standard therefore represents a god of the copious Lamaistic
mythology, but only the standards of the eleven chief
deities are brought out. The flag is square, but strips or
ribands of a different colour protrude at right angles from
the three free edges; there are white flags with blue strips,
blue flags with red ribands, red with blue, yellow with red
strips, etc. The flag is affixed in the usual way to a long
painted staff, round which it is wrapped when a lama brings
it out. He marches solemnly up, halts before the box of
the Tashi Lama, holds out the staff horizontally with the
assistance of a second lama, and unrolls the flag, and then
the emblem of the god is raised with a forked stick to
salute the Grand Lama. It is then lowered again, the flag
is rolled up, and the staff is carried sloped on the shoulder
of the bearer out through a gate beneath our balcony.
The same ceremony is observed with all the standards, and
as each is unfolded a subdued murmur of devotion rises
from the assembly.</p>

<p>After a short pause the trumpets sound again, and now
appear some lamas with white masks and white robes,
heralding a procession of monks, each of whom carries
some article used in the ritual of Buddhism, holy temple
vessels, golden bowls and chalices, censers of gold swinging
in their chains and emitting clouds of sweet-smelling
incense. Some of these monks appear in harness and
accoutrements; three masked lamas almost collapse under
the weight of their exceedingly costly vestments of red,
blue, and yellow gold-embroidered silk. Behind them six
copper trumpets, 10 feet long and bound with brass, are
carried, and are so heavy that their sound-bells must be
supported on the shoulders of young novices. They are
followed by a group of flutists, and then come forty men in
fanciful motley costly dresses, who bear drums held up
vertically on carved poles, and beat them with drumsticks
resembling a swan&rsquo;s neck. Now come the cymbals clashing
loudly and in regular time in the hands of monks clothed in
red silk. Nakchen, &ldquo;The Great Black Man,&rdquo; is the name
of a dressed-up monk who bears a hand-bell. Below, at the
stone steps, the court is spread with a square of carpets.
There the orchestra seats itself, the forty drums are held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
up parallel to one another, and likewise the trumpets,
which are now allowed to slope down to the pavement.
All the musicians wear yellow mitres somewhat like the
mitre of the Grand Lama. Three monks of high rank
come out on the gallery, which is situated on the short side
of the quadrangle immediately above the arena. They
wear yellow vestments and yellow mitres, and ring from
time to time brazen bells which they hold in their hands.
Each of them, I am told, is the superior of a thousand
monks; only three are present, for the fourth is ill. Tashi-lunpo
has 3800 monks at the present time.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">119. <span class="sc">Street in Tashi-lunpo, with Lamas.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>The curtain at the top of the stone staircase is opened
and a masked figure, named Argham, comes out with a
bowl full of goat&rsquo;s blood in his hand. He holds it horizontally
with outstretched arms while he executes a mystic
dance; suddenly he pours the blood over the steps. With
both arms extended, holding the bowl upside down, he
continues his dance, while some serving brothers hurry up
to wipe up the blood. Undoubtedly this ceremony is a relic
of the time when the original Bon religion prevailed in
Tibet, before the Indian monk Padma Sambhava in the
eighth century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> laid the foundation stone of Lamaism
by introducing Buddhism into Tibet; for Lamaism is
only a corrupt form of pure Buddhism, and under an
outward varnish of Buddhistic symbolism has incorporated
a number of Sivaistic elements, and has also retained the
superstitions which in pre-Buddhistic times found expression
in wild fanatical devil dances, rites, and sacrifices. The
object of these ceremonies was to exorcise, banish or propitiate
the powerful demons which reign everywhere, in the
air, on the earth, and in water, and whose only function is
to plague, torture, and persecute the children of men. At
that time the god of war and the demons were appeased by
human sacrifices, and the ceremony I have just described
is certainly a relic of these offerings. Of course Buddhism
had a better prospect of becoming popular in Tibet if as
much as possible of the old religion were incorporated in
the new. But the first command of the fundamental law
of Buddhism forbids to &ldquo;quench the vital spark,&rdquo; to kill.
This does not, however, prevent the monks from eating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
meat or making use of goat&rsquo;s blood in certain religious
rites&mdash;the sheep and goats are killed by ordinary butchers,
while the lamas themselves do not transgress the commandments
of the law.</p>

<p>Bagcham is the name of a dancer in a frightful devil&rsquo;s
mask; as he circles over the quadrangle, pieces of coloured
cloth flutter about on all sides. He is followed by eleven
masked lamas who execute the same movements. They
are joined by a troop of new performers in coloured garments
with necklaces, beads, and ornaments. They wear
a square collar with a round hole in the middle, which is
passed over the head, so that the collar rests on the
shoulders and stands out horizontally when they dance.
A great number of strips tied about the body swing out
like the skirts of a ballet-dancer when the dancers spin
round. They hold in their hands various religious objects
and long light strips, ribands, and streamers.</p>

<p>Again the curtain parts asunder, and preceded by
two flutists Chöjal Yum appears at the top of the steps,
the impersonation of a female spirit, and with a trident
in his hand performs a dance on the topmost step. Lastly,
lamas dance in hideous masks with large evil eyes and
Mephistophelian eyebrows, distorted features, and huge
tusks; others represent mythical wild beasts, all equally
terrible (Illustrations 115, 116, 117). At every new
number the three high priests ring their bells, and the
music continues without interruption, the discordant noise
awakening a thundering echo from the stone façades of
the narrow court. The drummers beat their instruments
slowly and in strict time, accompanied by the clash of the
cymbals, the weird, prolonged blasts of the trumpets, and
the more agreeable notes of the flutes. But now and then
the time is accelerated, the beats of the drum follow one
another more and more closely, and the claps of the
clashing basins pass into one continuous resonance. The
musicians seem to stimulate one another, and there is
a great crescendo; there is more than enough noise
to deafen one, so it is useless to attempt to speak to
one&rsquo;s neighbour. The dancing becomes more furious,
and undoubtedly the fanatical spectacle makes a deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
impression on the spectators. Now and then a fanatic is
overpowered by it, jumps up, and, turning towards the
Tashi Lama, grabs at his head with his hands, falls
forward with his hands and forehead on the ground, and
repeats this obeisance thrice&mdash;he has a deified man before
him. A greybeard from Chang-tang, sitting in his fur
coat just below our balcony, is unwearied in these observances,
and is constantly jumping up to make his reverence
to the Grand Lama; but once he slips on a piece of mandarin
peel and makes a frightful contortion, to the great
amusement of his neighbours. Other pilgrims take from
their girdles a small bag of rice or barley, and throw a
pinch or two into the court. This is an offering to the
temple, and is appropriated by the pigeons and sparrows.</p>

<p>Only the northern third of the quadrangle is required
for the religious diabolical masquerade; the other two-thirds
are left free for the poor of Shigatse and its environs.
There the crush is terrible, but now and then lictors, as
they may be called, armed with whips and rods, clear a
space. They strike right and left, and all the people bend
their backs under the blows, but their interference seems
only to increase the disorder. Among the pilgrims on the
platforms tea is distributed gratis by monks of low rank;
they carry large brass-bound copper cans on the right
shoulder, from which they fill the wooden cups held out by
their guests. <i>Panem et circenses!</i> The monks know how
to treat their lambs. What does it matter to them if they
give a few yak-loads of brick tea once or twice a year, when
they live exclusively at the expense of the people and from
the Peter&rsquo;s pence which flow continuously from the bags of
pilgrims into the temple treasury?</p>

<p>At length the lictors clear a space in the crowd below
us, where a fire is lighted. Two monks step forward and
hold a large sheet of paper horizontally over the fire at as
great a height as possible; on this paper is written down all
the evil from which protection is desired during the year
now commencing, and all the affairs in which a triumph is
hoped for over the designs and influence of wicked demons.
The paper also represents the past year with all its sufferings
and all its sins. A lama walks up to the fire with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
wand in one hand and a bowl in the other. He recites
some formulæ of incantation, performs all kinds of mystical
hocus pocus with his arms, and throws the contents of the
bowl, some inflammable stuff, into the flames, which blaze
up brightly and consume in a moment the paper, the passing
year with its sins, and all the power of the demons.
All the spectators rise and break out into prolonged shouts
of rejoicing, for now evil is crushed and every one may rest
in peace. The last number of the day&rsquo;s programme was a
general dance of all the lamas in the courtyard.</p>

<p>Now the Tashi Lama rises and slowly retires from the
scene of the festival, followed by his retinue. After his
departure the pilgrims withdraw in perfect order, quietly
and without crushing, and take their way down to Shigatse
in a black stream of humanity. When the last have disappeared,
we look for our horses, accompanied by our new
friends.</p>

<p>The jugglery we had witnessed was in every respect
brilliant, gorgeous, and splendid, and it is easy to imagine
the feelings of humility such a performance must inspire in
the mind of the simple pilgrim from the desolate mountains
or the peaceful valleys. While the original signification of
these dramatic masquerades and these mystic plays is the
exorcising and expelling of inimical demons, they are in
the hands of the clergy a means of retaining the credulous
masses in the net of the Church, and this is a condition
of the existence both of the Church and of the priests.
Nothing imposes on ignorance so thoroughly as fearful
scenes from the demon world, and therefore devils and
monsters play a prominent part in the public masquerades
of the monasteries. With their help and by representations
of the King of Death, Yama, and of restless wandering
souls vainly seeking new forms of existence in the
sequence of transmigrations, the monks terrify the multitude
and render them meek and subservient, and show many a
poor sinner what obstacles and what trials await him on
the rough road to Nirvana through the valley of the
shadow of death.</p>

<p>On our way back we returned the visit of my friend Ma.
His <i>yamen</i> was built in the usual Chinese style and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
surrounded by a wall. I was invited to take my place on
the seat of honour beside a small table, on which attentive
servants placed tea, sweetmeats, and cigarettes. The
whole room was full of Chinamen, but Ma was as amiable
as before.</p>

<p>Lobsang Tsering and Tsaktserkan were waiting in my
garden. They had brought a whole caravan of mules
laden with <i>tsamba</i>, rice, meal, dried fruit, and barley for
our horses&mdash;supplies sufficient for our whole party for a full
month. They also handed me 46 silver <i>tengas</i> (barely 20
shillings) wrapped in paper, with which, they believed, we
should buy meat, for the Tashi Lama must have no hand
in anything which involved the extinction of the vital
spark. The envoys also said that His Holiness expected me
at nine o&rsquo;clock the following morning, and that they would
come to fetch me. But I was not to tell Ma or any one
else that the Tashi Lama was going to receive me. For
the rest, I had only to say a word and all my wishes would
be fulfilled. Later in the evening a subordinate official
presented himself with the information that no one would
fetch me; I was to be at the great portal at nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;for
the Chinese might become suspicious. At night I took
out of Burroughs and Wellcome&rsquo;s large medicine chest all
the drugs which I thought we might want, and we packed
them in labelled bags. The chest itself, of aluminium, and
all its elegant tabloid boxes, bottles, cases, bandages, and
instruments were rubbed and polished up till they shone
like silver, and then wrapped in a large piece of yellow silk
which Muhamed Isa had picked up in the bazaar, for it
was next day to be my friendship&rsquo;s offering to the Panchen
Rinpoche.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXV</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE TASHI LAMA</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> 12th of February came, the day on which I was to be
received by the holiest man in Tibet. I therefore made
myself as spruce as I had ever done for a ball in a British
Government House, and then, accompanied by the same
men as to the performance, rode up to the main entrance
to Tashi-lunpo, where Tsaktserkan, Lobsang Tsering, and
some monks awaited us. In their company we ascended
to the higher regions, through a labyrinth of gloomy lanes
and dark narrow cloisters, to the Labrang, where the Tashi
Lama lives&mdash;the Vatican, with its white façade, its large
quaint windows, and its solid balconies standing high
above this town of temple buildings (Illustration 121).
Our conductor leads us into cold dark rooms, up unusually
steep staircases. The steps, in which the soles of the
monks have worn deep hollows, are edged with iron, and
the round bars of the balustrade are polished by innumerable
hands. The steps are dark, and our friends warn us
to mount slowly and cautiously. Then there is light, and
we are taken out on to a gallery, a roof, but only to plunge
again into a maze of dark passages and flights of steps. I
am asked to wait in a room with red cushions on the floor.
Before long we are informed that the man next in rank to
the Tashi Lama, the honourable fat little lama, who holds
the post of a minister of state, is ready to receive us. His
audience chamber, or rather his private cell, is quite a small
room, but from its single window he enjoys a beautiful view
over the sacred town of Shigatse and the rocky mountains
of the neighbourhood. The room is fitted up with solid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
unpretentious, and genuine Lamaist luxury. Red carpets lie
on the floor, and the ceiling and walls are also red, that is,
all that can be seen of them, for most of the walls are hidden
by artistically carved cabinets with red lacquer, and decorated
in colours and inlaid metal work. On these stand large
silver <i>gaos</i> containing images of the gods, and before them
smaller ones of solid gold, between bowls with offerings or
wicks burning with a dull flame in butter. Other objects
may be seen which the monks use in their services: bells,
cymbals, holy water vessels, and a <i>dorche</i>, the thunderbolt,
emblem of power, which resembles a sceptre. To the left,
in a window niche, hangs a flag-like picture (<i>tanka</i>) of the
first Tashi Lama, and to the right a similar portrait of the
ecclesiastical prince Sakya Pandita.</p>

<p>The venerable prelate sat cross-legged on a bench fixed
against the wall and covered with red cushions, and before
him stood a small, yellow, carved table with silken material
inserted in the top. He beamed with fat, inward complacence
and goodwill, like any other cardinal; his features
were finely cut, and his eyes indicated great intelligence.
When I entered he rose with a polite smile and invited me
to be seated on a chair by the table, whereupon the inevitable
tea was served. Just as indispensable is it to exchange
<i>kadakhs</i> and presents. I gave him an engraved dagger
from Kashmir, and he presented to me a gilt idol&mdash;there
is the difference between secular and ecclesiastical presents.
We talked about an hour over one thing or another, and
His Eminence begged me to excuse the delay, but the
Panchen Rinpoche was absorbed in meditation and
occupied with his daily prayers, and might not be disturbed
till he himself gave a sign.</p>

<p>This moment came at length: a lama whispered to the
cardinal that I was expected. We go still higher up smooth
steep staircases to open landings, up more steps, higher and
higher to the holiest of holies in the monastery of Tashi-lunpo.
The conversation is carried on in lower, more
subdued tones, one dares no longer speak loud; small
groups of lamas stand in the corridors and passages, silent
as statues, and look at me as I pass by. Lobsang Tsering
tells me in a whisper that we are now in the last antechamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span>
where I can make myself ready and put on
the black shoes. Here my servants are ordered to remain,
except Robert and Muhamed Isa. If I could have dispensed
with interpreters His Holiness would have seen me
quite alone.</p>

<p>We enter, not without feeling solemn. I make a deep
bow at the door, and two more before I stand before him.
The Tashi Lama is sitting on a bench in a window recess
and has in front of him a small table with a tea-cup, a telescope,
and some printed sheets. He is dressed as simply
as an ordinary monk, wears a cerise costume of the usual
style, coat, waistcoat, vest, and the long scarf which is
thrown over the shoulder and wound round the body like
a toga; between its folds peeps out a yellow under-vest
with gold embroidery; both arms are bare and the head
is uncovered.</p>

<p>His complexion is fair, slightly inclining to yellow; he
is somewhat below the middle height, is well proportioned,
looks healthy, and at his twenty-fifth year, lately completed,
has every prospect of attaining a good old age. In his
small, soft, delicate hands he holds a rosary of red beads.
His short-cropped hair is black, and there is scarcely any
down on his upper lip; his lips are not thick and full like
those of other Tibetans, but thin and gracefully formed,
and his eyes are of a chestnut-brown colour.</p>

<p>Nodding kindly, he gives me both his hands and invites
me to sit in an arm-chair beside him. The apartment, in
which he spends the greater part of the day, is astonishingly
plain, quite a contrast to that of the cardinal in the lower
regions. It is small and consists of two parts: the outer is
a kind of roofless ante-room, exposed to all the winds of
heaven, to the snow in winter and the pouring rain in
autumn; the inner is raised a step, and is again separated
by a division ending in a grille, behind which his bedroom
is situated. There is not a single idol, no wall painting or
other mural decoration, no furniture except what has been
already mentioned, not a thread of carpet, only the bare
stone floor&mdash;and through the window his melancholy and
dreamy, but clear and open, glances wander over the
golden temple roofs, over the town below them with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
dirt and sinfulness, over the dreary mountains which bound
his earthly horizon, and away through the azure-blue sky
to a Nirvana invisible to us, where his spirit will one day
find rest. Now he descended from his heaven and became
a man for a moment. But all the time he preserved a
wonderful calmness, a refined, amiable politeness and
dignity, and spoke in a charmingly soft and subdued
voice, modest, almost shy; he spoke quickly and in short
sentences, but in a very low tone.</p>

<p>What did we talk about? Why, about all kinds of
things in heaven and earth, beginning from his own
religion, in the Pantheon of which he himself takes the
highest rank among living prelates, down to the yaks that
roam wild over Chang-tang. He displayed an alertness,
an interest in everything, and an intelligence that surprised
me in a Tibetan. I have never been interviewed so
thoroughly and with so much tact. Firstly, he inquired
if I had suffered much from the cold and hardships in
Chang-tang, and whether we had had great losses. Then
he hoped I would excuse the sorry entertainment I had
met with; it was all owing to my having arrived quietly
and unnoticed, and no one knew whether I was the man
who was expected and of whose probable arrival information
had been received from India. But now everything
possible should be done for my welfare and convenience,
and he wished and hoped that I should carry back with
me a pleasant remembrance of his country.</p>

<p>Then followed inquiries about my name, my age, my
caravan, the routes by which I had come; my country, its
size and population, its position with regard to Russia and
England; whether Sweden was dependent on a neighbouring
country or had a king of its own; the best way to travel
to Sweden, how long it took to travel there, and what
season was the most suitable&mdash;just as if he intended to
return my visit. Then he asked about the various
European countries and their rulers, their relative power
and extent; about the war between Russia and Japan,
about the great naval battles and the armoured vessels
which had sunk; the effect the result of the war would have
on Eastern Asia; about the Emperor of Japan and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
Emperor of China&mdash;apparently he had the greatest respect
for the latter. He asked what countries I had visited, and
whether I had seen much of India, where he had been so
well received a year ago. He spoke with pleasure of his
impressions of India, of the large cities with their fine
buildings, of the Indian army, the railways, the splendour
and wealth everywhere apparent, and the hospitality shown
him by the Lord Sahib (the Viceroy). &ldquo;Promise me to
greet the Lord Sahib from me when you write, and tell him
that I still think of his kindness, and greet Lord Kitchener;&rdquo;
and then he showed me a photograph with the autograph
of the great General. He was particularly pleased at having
been able to visit the holy places he knew so well from
descriptions and pictures, which were connected with the
great founder of his religion, Buddha, especially Buddh
Gaya in Magadha, where Prince Sarvarthasidda, the son of
Buddha, had passed six years in solitude and meditation,
overcome Mâra, the tempter, the ruler of the world of
lust, and had attained to perfect wisdom.</p>

<p>To the Tashi Lama, then, the journey to India had
been of the nature of a pilgrimage, though from the
English point of view the invitation had been rather
connected with political considerations. It was, of course,
important to the English in India to have a neighbour on
their northern frontier on whose faith and friendship they
could rely in unsettled times. As long ago as the year
1774 the great Warren Hastings had sent Bogle as
ambassador to the third Tashi Lama, to obtain information
about the country, and, if possible, to establish commercial
relations. And in 1783 he had sent Turner to the
fourth Tashi Lama. Now, 120 years later, the sixth
Tashi Lama had been invited to visit India himself, that
he might observe with his own eyes the wealth, might, and
prestige of the English. No efforts were spared to make
a lasting impression on the influential ecclesiastical prince.
Later events have proved that this project has failed. The
journey of the Tashi Lama to India met with great opposition
in Tibet, and gave rise to much suspicion. And great
was the joy when he returned in safety; for the Church
could not afford to lose, perhaps, the Tashi Lama also, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
the Dalai Lama had disappeared from the country. What
would become of the re-incarnation when no one knew
where the two popes were dwelling?</p>

<p>Then he turned the conversation to the European
Powers, and thought that Europe was a singular mosaic of
states. He brought out a picture showing all the more
powerful supreme rulers of the earth. Under each portrait
the name and country were written in Tibetan
characters. He put many questions about each monarch,
and showed the liveliest interest in their fortunes&mdash;he who
is more powerful than all the kings of the world, for he
rules over the faith and the souls of men from the
Kalmucks on the Volga to the Buryats on Lake Baikal,
from the shores of the Arctic Ocean to the burning sun
of India.</p>

<p>I am not the first European whom Tubden Chöki
Nima Gelég Namgyal, the sixth Tashi Lama, has
received in the Labrang at Tashi-lunpo. After Younghusband&rsquo;s
expedition, Major W. F. O&rsquo;Connor was admitted
to an audience in the autumn of 1904 as representative of
the Indian Government, and on this occasion he was
accompanied by four officers of the Gartok Mission, Major
Ryder, Captains Rawling and Wood, and Lieutenant Bailey.
O&rsquo;Connor, who knows the Tibetan language, was Younghusband&rsquo;s
interpreter in Lhasa and the Tashi Lama&rsquo;s in
India, and in his capacity as British Trade Agent in Gyangtse
had frequently occasion to negotiate with the pope in
Tashi-lunpo. Also, immediately after his return home in
1906, the Tashi Lama received Captain Fitzgerald, Lord
Kitchener&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, and Mr. David Fraser.</p>

<p>Of the two supreme pontiffs of the yellow-caps Köppen
says: &ldquo;Of these the Panchen Rinpoche at Tashi-lunpo is
usually supposed to be an incarnation of the Dhyani
Buddha of the present age of the world, Amitabha, but
also an incarnation of the Bodhisattvas, Manjusri and
Vajrapani, and lastly almost as a re-birth of the reformer
Tsong Kapa, the founder of the yellow-caps; the Dalai
Lama, on the other hand, is always held to be a re-incarnation
of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (Padmapani)....&rdquo;
In the same work the functions of teacher and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
king are divided between the two Lamaist popes, the former
being especially assigned to the Panchen, the latter to the
Dalai Lama. And this is also signified by the titles of the
two potentates, for the former is called Panchen Rinpoche,
&ldquo;the Great Precious Teacher,&rdquo; and the latter Gyalpo
Rinpoche, &ldquo;the Precious King.&rdquo; In consequence of this
idea the Dalai Lama has at length become the temporal
ruler of the greater part of Tibet, though he owes his
position more to the situation and historical connections of
his capital than to this scholastic theory of sanctity, just as
the Vicar of Christ on the seven hills owes his supremacy
to the importance of the city of Rome. The great teacher
(the Tashi Lama) has therefore for the present to content
himself with a comparatively small territory, combined with
a reputation for sanctity and omniscience, and the privilege
of acting as tutor and guardian to an infant Dalai Lama.</p>

<p>And Waddell says of the respective spheres of the two
popes: &ldquo;The Tashi-lunpo Grand Lamas are considered to
be, if possible, holier even than those of Lhasa, as they are
less contaminated with temporal government and worldly
politics and more famous for their learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shall show later that this relation between the two
Lamaist popes underwent great modifications in favour of
the Tashi Lama during the period of my last journey.
The expectations of the English, that they would gain an
influence in Tibet through the friendship of the Tashi
Lama, were to a certain extent justified; but they had not
taken into consideration that the temporal power lost by
the Dalai Lama by no means passed over to the Tashi
Lama, whose temporal authority was confined within the
boundaries of the province Chang, and even there was
limited by the universal supremacy of China. The Dalai
Lama accordingly had much to lose, the Tashi Lama little
or nothing. The Dalai Lama was an ambitious intriguer,
who by his incautious policy provoked the offensive measures
of Lord Curzon so disastrous for Tibet, and thereby
lost almost everything. And if the Tashi Lama had
already enjoyed a greater reputation for holiness and
learning than his colleague in Lhasa, his renown and his
spiritual influence were much enhanced when the result of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
the war proved that the fine promises of the Dalai Lama
were all lies and humbug, and only tended to secure more
firmly the heavy yoke of the Chinese on the necks of the
Tibetans. Shortly before my visit the Tashi Lama had had
an opportunity of reminding the Lamaist hierarchy of his
illustrious existence. When he reached the age of twenty-five
he sent presents of money to all the monasteries of
Tibet, inviting all the monks to a great banquet in their own
convents at his expense; a special embassy of monks was
despatched to Ladak, and others to Lhasa, Sekiya, Tashi-gembe,
and other places. The twenty-fifth anniversary of
his birth was celebrated throughout the Lamaist world.</p>

<p>But we will return to the audience. Lamas, walking
on their toes and silent as phantoms, handed us tea and
fruits continually. The Tashi Lama drank a sip from his
plain cup with me, as though to show that he did not consider
himself too holy to sit at table with an unbeliever.
Some Lamas who stood in the room at a distance were
now and then dismissed by a wave of the hand when he
wished to put some question he did not want them to hear.
This was particularly the case when he requested me not
to let the Chinese know that he had entertained me, though
it could hardly escape their penetration.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">123. <span class="sc">View of a Part of Tashi-lunpo, with the Façade of a Mausoleum of a Grand Lama.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>I seized the opportunity to beg for certain favours. I
asked permission to photograph him. Oh, certainly, I
might come again with my camera, if I liked. I asked to
be allowed to see the whole of Tashi-lunpo, and to draw
and photograph in the cloister town at my pleasure. &ldquo;Yes,
by all means; I have already ordered the lamas to show
you everything.&rdquo; And, finally, I begged for a passport for
future journeys in his country, for an official of the Labrang,
and some reliable men as escort. This, too, was granted
me, and all was to be in order when I had fixed the day of
my departure. All these promises were fulfilled to the
smallest detail, and if China had not just at this time seized
Tibet more tightly than ever in its dragon&rsquo;s claws, the
Tashi Lama would certainly have been powerful enough to
throw every door open to me. But at any rate his friendship
and favour were an excellent recommendation in all
my subsequent journeys, and extricated me from many a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
difficult situation. Pilgrims from all parts of Tibet had
seen with their own eyes how well I was received. They
had boundless respect for the Tashi Lama, reposed in him
the most sincere confidence, and reasoned as follows:
&ldquo;Whoever this stranger may be, he must be an eminent
lama in his own country, or the Panchen Rinpoche would
never have treated him as his equal.&rdquo; And then these
pilgrims returned to their black tents in distant provinces
and related to others what they had seen, and when we
arrived with our small caravan all knew who we were.
Eighteen months later it came about that chiefs and monks
said: &ldquo;Bombo Chimbo, we know that you are a friend of
the Tashi Lama, and we are at your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we had conversed for two hours, I made a move
to leave him, but the Tashi Lama pushed me back on to
the chair and said: &ldquo;No, stay a little longer.&rdquo; And this
was repeated till quite three hours had passed. How many
millions of believers would have given years of their lives
for such a privilege! The pilgrims who had travelled
hundreds of miles to get a sight of him must be content
with a nod of the head and a blessing from a distance.</p>

<p>Now was the time to present my offering. The elegant
English medicine chest was taken out of its silk cloth,
opened and exhibited, and excited his great admiration and
lively interest&mdash;everything must be explained to him. The
hypodermic syringe in its tasteful aluminium case with all
its belongings especially delighted him. Two monks of the
medical faculty were sent for several days running to our
camp to write down in Tibetan the contents of the various
tabloid boxes and the use of the medicines. But I warned
them, as well as the Tashi Lama, against making a trial of
their effect before consulting Major O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s physician
in Gyangtse. There was not much danger, however, for
the lamas believe that their medical knowledge is much
superior to that of Europeans.</p>

<p>Wonderful, never-to-be-forgotten Tashi Lama! Never
has any man made so deep and ineffaceable impression on
me. Not as a divinity in human form, but as a man, who
in goodness of heart, innocence, and purity approaches as
near as possible to perfection. I shall never forget his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
expression: it displayed unbounded kindness, humility,
and philanthropy; and I have never seen such a smile, a
mouth so delicately formed, so noble a countenance. His
smile never left him: he smiled like a sleeper dreaming of
something beautiful and desirable, and whenever our eyes
met, his smile grew broader, and he nodded kindly and
amiably, as much as to say: &ldquo;Trust in my friendship implicitly,
for my intentions are good towards all men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The incarnation of Amitabha! The earthly shell in
which the soul of Amitabha lives on through time! Therefore
a deity full of supernatural wisdom and omniscience.
The Tibetans believe that he knows not only what is and
has been, but also all that is to come. Can he be Amitabha
himself? This much is certain, that he is a very extraordinary
man, a singular, unique, and incomparable man.
I told him that I thought myself fortunate to have seen
him, and that I should never forget the hours I had spent
in his company; and he replied that he should be very
pleased if I came back again.</p>

Foreground</span>.</td></tr></table>

<p>After I had thanked him once more for his generous
hospitality and kindness, he called some lamas and ordered
them to show me the temples. Then he gave me both his
hands, and followed me with his wonderful smile as I
bowed myself out. His friendly eyes did not leave me
till I had passed through the door leading into the ante-chamber.
At the foot of the first staircase several lamas
were waiting; they smiled in silence, and with wide-opened
eyes, no doubt thinking that so long an audience was an
unusual favour. Henceforth they all treated me with
greater respect, and it was evident that very evening that
the whole bazaar and all the town of Shigatse knew that
I had spent three hours with the holy one. For my part
I could hardly think of anything else but the Tashi Lama
and the powerful impression he had made on me. I left
the Labrang, his cloister palace, intoxicated and bewitched
by his personality. This one day was worth many days in
Tibet, and I felt that I had now beheld what was most
remarkable in the country, scarcely surpassed by the massive
mountains with their snow-capped summits, which
from remote periods have looked down on the births and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
deaths of generations in the valleys which wind about their
feet.</p>

<p>During our sojourn in Shigatse we made many friends
among the monks of Tashi-lunpo, who gave us right
willingly all the elucidations we asked for. One told us
that a Tashi Lama, when he feels the approach of death,
must in accordance with the directions of the holy law
remain in a sitting position, with his legs tucked under
him and his hands palms upwards in his lap, for he must
die in the same attitude as the meditating Buddha. His
last moments are soothed by a number of monks who
surround him on all sides, fill the air with the murmur of
their prayers, and continually prostrate themselves with
their hands and foreheads on the ground, paying divine
honours to him and his departing spirit. When he has
lost consciousness, has no longer any control over his body,
and becomes limp, he is held up, and when life has flown
he is so placed that he grows rigid in the orthodox position.
The corpse is clothed in priestly vestments, all new and
never worn before, and then the tall mitre is placed on his
head. Prayers for the dead are recited, mystic rites are
performed, and the corpse is placed as quickly as possible,
still in a sitting posture, in a metal vessel which is filled
with salt and hermetically sealed. Then his mortuary
chapel must be prepared, and as this must be erected in a
massive stone building, and be decorated within with great
art and expense, it may be a long time before his dust is
finally laid to rest. The cost is borne by the pilgrims and
devotees of the country, and in consequence of his death
the Peter&rsquo;s pence flow in more plentifully than ever, for it
is a good deed to contribute to the interment of a Tashi
Lama. Such liberality secures privileges to the donor in
his soul&rsquo;s wanderings.</p>

<p>After the decease, Amitabha clothes himself in the body
of a newly born boy, and the difficulty is to discover where
this boy is. Therefore letters are sent to all parts of Tibet
and to all the adjoining Lamaist countries, in which inquiries
are made whether a child of the male sex, endowed with
extraordinary spiritual gifts, has appeared. Numerous
replies come in. After one after another has been rejected,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
the boy must certainly be among the remainder, and the
right one has to be found out. The names of the boys are
written on strips of paper, which are rolled up and deposited
in a covered bowl, and this is placed before the image of
one of the chief gods, probably before Amitabha or Tsong
Kapa, whereupon high cardinals offer up prayers before the
bowl, recite appropriate texts from the holy scriptures,
present gifts to the gods, burn incense and perform other
ceremonies, and then the cover is removed, and the first
ticket taken out gives the name of the new Panchen
Rinpoche. The decision of this lottery must, however,
be ratified by the Dalai Lama before it can have legal
force, and from him the new pontiff, an innocent child,
receives his consecration. If the Dalai Lama is absent,
or is himself a minor, this is conferred by a conclave of
the higher priests.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Volumes</span> would be required in which to describe a
monastery such as Tashi-lunpo in all its details, its intricate
conglomeration of stone buildings connected with one another
by passages, corridors, staircases, and terraces, or separated
by narrow deep lanes or small open squares; its many
temple halls with an innumerable host of images; its
monks&rsquo; cells, lecture halls, mortuary chapels, kitchens,
factories, warehouses for provisions and materials; its
complicated organization in spiritual and temporal affairs,
its festivals and ceremonies. Such a description could only
be compiled by an intimate acquaintance with the Lamaist
hierarchy and Church, and this knowledge could only be
attained by the ardent study of a whole lifetime; for
those who would penetrate deeply into the mysteries of
Lamaism must gain a thorough knowledge of Buddhism
and its relations to Brahminism and Hinduism, and understand
the influence which Sivaism has exerted on the
religion of the Tibetans, and must be familiar with the
elements of the ancient Bon religion and its fetichism and
Shamanism, which have crept in and corrupted the Lamaistic
form of Buddhism. Such a task lies beyond the scope of
this work for many reasons, not least because I have only
a dim conception of the essentials of Lamaism.<a name="fa1" id="fa1" href="#ft1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> I shall
therefore content myself with depicting the system from its

picturesque side, and describing the outward ordinances I
had an opportunity of observing personally. I shall write
the names phonetically, without all the silent consonants
which render a conscientious translation unintelligible to
those who have not devoted much time to the study of
the Tibetan language.</p>

<p>Tashi-lunpo must not be conceived as a single vast block
of buildings, but as a cloister town within an enclosing wall, a
town of at least a hundred separate houses, very irregularly
built and grouped, joined together in rows divided by
narrow lanes (Illustration 118). On the south side of the
Tsangpo a rocky spur projects from the mountains eastwards
into the valley of the Nyang-chu; below and to the
east of this cliff lies Shigatse in the broad valley on the
northern, left bank of the river, while the monastery is
built on the lower part of the southern slope of the ridge,
and therefore faces south. Looking from the plain to the
south of the monastery at this conglomeration of white
houses, one notices at once some striking features which
facilitate the orientation. On the extreme right is a high
thick wall without windows, from the top of which large
pictures are exposed to view during certain summer
festivals. A little to the left of it, the grand white façade
of the Labrang, with its solid, simple, and tasteful architecture,
rises above all the cloister town, and in front of
and below the Labrang five buildings, quite alike in
appearance, catch the eye&mdash;massive towers with golden
roofs in the Chinese style. They form a line running
from west to east, and are the mausoleums of the five
earlier Tashi Lamas. The remaining space within the
wall around and below them is occupied by all the other
houses, and wherever you stand on their flat roofs the first
and the last objects you see are these mausoleums; for
Tashi-lunpo has also a system of aerial streets and places,
as they may be called, that is, the roofs protected by low
parapets. In the deep lanes one is quite unable to find the
way unless one is very familiar with them, for only the
nearest high walls can be seen, consisting either of an
unbroken smooth surface or interrupted by large long
windows in black frames. The walls all slope a little inwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
so that all the lanes between the houses are narrowest at the
bottom. The pavement is irregular, worn, and smooth;
some lanes and open squares are not paved at all. All
these constructions are solidly and firmly built, and planned
so as to defy time as well as the rude climate of Tibet.</p>

<p>Tashi-lunpo was founded in the year <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1445 by
Ge-dun-dup, the nephew of Tsong Kapa, who in the year
1439 was installed as Grand Lama of the Gelugpa sect,
though he did not yet bear the title of Dalai Lama. The
present Grand Lama of Lhasa, Ngavang Lobsang Tubden
Gyamtso, who has now held the office for thirty-four years,
is the thirteenth in succession. This number is not to be
compared with the long list of Roman Popes. The first
Panchen Rinpoche of Tashi-lunpo was named Panchen
Lobsang Chöki Gyaltsan, and held the dignity of pope from
1569 to 1662, or ninety-three years&mdash;certainly a world record.
His mortuary chapel, Chukang-sher, or the East Tomb, is
the one to which we shall first direct our steps.</p>

<p>Its façade faces the rectangular court where the
ceremonies are performed, its portal stands at a level with
the uppermost platform for spectators, and above the door
hang large white awnings beneath a symbolic decoration&mdash;a
wheel between two gilded stags. The roof is made of
gilded copper sheeting, and is divided into two sections by
a platform with a parapet (Illustration 124).</p>

<p>The interior of the mausoleum is a cubical room,
illuminated only by the daylight, which enters through the
portal and mingles effectively with the pale gleam of the
butter-fed wicks in a row of silver saucers and brazen
bowls. The middle bowl is larger than the others, is like
a caldron, and has a cover with a round hole through which
a sacrificial flame rises from the melting butter. Before
this cordon of butter lamps, on a rather higher super-altar,
stand a row of pyramidal figures of baked paste, painted
in front with various colours and representing different
Lamaistic symbols. Behind them is a row of bowls and
chalices of solid gold and silver, donations of wealthy
pilgrims. They contain pure water, meal, barley, rice, and
other edible offerings.</p>

<p>The tomb itself, in the interior, is a <i>chhorten</i> in the form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
of a pyramid with steps, ledges, and cornices, and may be
20 to 23 feet high. All the front is decorated with
gold and silver in arabesques and other designs, and is
studded with precious stones. At the very top stands a
<i>gao</i>, a yard high, somewhat like a sentry-box, with a front
of lotus leaves, and in it sits a statue of the deceased
wearing the usual mitre, with which Tsong Kapa is always
represented, and of which we saw so many specimens
during the festival. A number of long silken <i>kadakhs</i>
have been placed in the uplifted hands of the statue, and
hang down over the monument in long festoons and
streamers. This is also draped with a multitude of <i>tankas</i>,
temple banners which are painted in Lhasa and Tashi-lunpo,
and represent scenes from the life of the founder of
the religion and of the Church fathers. Among and
behind them also hang standards and pennants of coloured
cloth narrowing to a point at the bottom, and all are old,
dusty, and dingy (Illustrations 125, 126).</p>

<p>This <i>chhorten</i> with its richly decorated front and its
motley surroundings stands alone in the cubical chapel,
and a narrow, pitch-dark passage runs round it; at the
back, by the light of a paper lantern, the solid foundation
of masonry, on which the monument rests, may be seen.
The pilgrims circle round it, the more times the better,
and the orthodox &ldquo;Gelugpa,&rdquo; members of the &ldquo;sect of
virtue,&rdquo; always walk in the direction of the hands of a
watch, that is, they turn on entering to the left. The
monks, who act as guides, insist that we also shall conform
to this regulation.</p>

<p>Now we cross again the court of ceremonies, and are
conducted slowly through narrow corridors to a somewhat
lighter gallery, where we can look down into a <i>dukang</i>,
a hall where the high office is performed five times a day.
Red mattresses, much the worse for wear, lie in rows on the
smooth stone floor, on which the monks sit cross-legged
during the mass. In the middle of the shorter side stands
a papal throne, with back and arms, and covered with
yellow silk&mdash;it is the seat of the Grand Lama, who on
certain occasions teaches and preaches here.</p>

<p>Then we are led to the Yalloa-champa, a holy apartment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
with a curtain formed of a network of iron rings,
through which we catch a glimpse of some dark idols and
a quantity of Chinese porcelain bowls. Illuminated by
butter lamps and draped with long silken cloths, here
stands a figure of Dolma, one of the two wives of Srong
Tsan Ganpo, the first Tibetan king, both very popular in
Tibet, and immortalized in most Lama temples. It is
said of the statue here that it once exchanged words of
wisdom with a monk. In another compartment we find
Tsong Kapa&rsquo;s statue veiled in silken draperies, and also
a figure of the second Tashi Lama, the Panchen Lobsang
Yishe.</p>

<p>The library is called Kanjur-lhakang, and here the
bible of the Tibetans in 100 to 108 folios, the Kanjur, is
kept, studied, and explained. It contains a collection of
canonical works which were translated from the Sanscrit
originals in the ninth century. The hall is as dark as a
subterranean crypt, its red-painted wooden pillars are hung
with unframed pictures, <i>tankas</i>, painted with minute artistic
detail, and on the walls also a host of gods are depicted
in colours. At the upper, shorter side is a row of altars,
with images of gods in niches, and figures of Tashi Lamas
and other great priests. Before these, too, butter lamps
are burning, and smooth bright brazen bowls are filled
to the brim with offerings. The illumination is scanty
and mystical as everywhere in Tashi-lunpo; it seems as
though the monks needed darkness to strengthen their
faith in the incredible and supernatural literature that they
read and study here (Illustration 127).</p>

<p>Proceeding westwards along the lane which runs in
front of the mausoleums, we look into the monument of the
second supreme pontiff and then into that of the third.
They were named Panchen Lobsang Yishe (1663-1737)
and Panchen Lobsang Palden Yishe (1737-1779). The
mausoleums are built after the pattern of the one already
described, but between the entrance pillars of the third
hangs a shield bearing the name of the Emperor Kien
Lung in raised characters. Köppen gives in his book
some interesting information about the relations of the
great Manchu Emperor with this Tashi Lama. Kien
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
Lung (1736-1795) sent many letters to the Grand Lama
from the year 1777 inviting him to come to Pekin, but the
latter suspected treachery and made all kinds of excuses.
But the Emperor was so persistent that at length in July
of the year 1779 the prelate had to set out. After a
journey of three months he reached the monastery Kum-bum.
Wherever the holy caravan passed crowds of
pilgrims collected to worship the Grand Lama and offer
him presents. He passed the winter at Kum-bum, and
made daily several thousand impressions of his hand on
paper, which were well paid for as relics. One rich chief
alone is said to have presented him with 300 horses, 70
mules, 100 camels, 1000 pieces of brocade, and 150,000
shillings in silver. Escorted by princes, governors, officials,
and soldiers, and also by the chief court lama of the
Emperor, Chancha Khutukhtu, he reached, after a further
journey of two months, Kien Lung&rsquo;s summer residence,
where he was received with magnificent pomp and state
and brilliant fêtes. The Son of Heaven was pleased to
allow himself to be instructed by the holy man in the
truths of religion. While the Emperor was visiting the
tombs of his ancestors in Mukden, the Tashi Lama made
his triumphal entry into Pekin, where all, from the imperial
princes to the mob in the streets, wished to see him and
receive his blessing. Even the imperial favourites insisted
obstinately on seeing His Holiness, on which occasion he
sat dumb and motionless behind a transparent curtain,
casting down his eyes so as not to be polluted by the
sight of beautiful women.</p>

Water-colour Sketch by the Author.</td></tr></table>

<p>But all this worldly glory came to a sudden and deplorable
end. The Tashi Lama fell ill and died, and it was
affirmed that the powerful Emperor had caused him to be
poisoned, because he suspected him of a design to free
himself from the supremacy of China with the help of
the Governor-General of India; for it was to this third
Tashi Lama that Warren Hastings had sent Bogle as
ambassador six years previously. If our friend, the
present Tashi Lama, had thought of this circumstance he
would perhaps have preferred to omit his visit to India.
The Emperor pretended to be inconsolable, had the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
embalmed, and masses said for three months over the golden
sarcophagus, and then the body was carried on men&rsquo;s
shoulders all the way to Tashi-lunpo, the journey lasting
seven months, and was there deposited in the splendid
mausoleum to which we paid a flying visit (Illustration 128).</p>

<p>Our next visit is to the so-called Namgyal-lhakang,
the temple of Tsong Kapa, a large pillared hall with a huge
statue of the reformer; before it and its companion images
stand the usual battery of lamps, sacred vessels, and Lamaistic
emblems. The temple watchman, housed in a small
recess in the entrance hall, is a jovial septuagenarian who
has lived sixteen years in Mongolia, and always comes out
to inquire after my health when I pass the temple of Tsong
Kapa on my way from or to the western buildings of
Tashi-lunpo (Illustrations 129, 163).</p>

<p>Tsong Kapa&rsquo;s name is as famous and as highly revered
in the Lamaistic Church as that of Buddha himself: I cannot
recall to mind that his statue is absent in one of the
many temples I have visited in Tibet. He was born in
Amdo in the year 1355, and of course his birth was attended
by all kinds of supernatural circumstances. At the age of
three years he decided to retire from the world, and therefore
his mother cut off his hair, which became the roots of
the famous miraculous tree in Kum-bum (the temple of the
&ldquo;hundred thousand statues&rdquo;), on the leaves of which
Father Huc read with his own eyes holy inscriptions.
Unfortunately my own visit to Kum-bum was in the
winter of 1896 when the holy tree was leafless. After a
thorough course of study Tsong Kapa formed the resolution
of reforming the dissolute and corrupted Lamaism, and in
several public conferences he silenced, like Luther, all his
opponents. The number of his followers rapidly increased,
and in the year 1407 he founded the monastery Galdan,
near Lhasa, becoming its first abbot, and subsequently the
equally large and famous monasteries Brebung and Sera.
Tsong Kapa introduced celibacy among the monks of his
sect, which he called &ldquo;Gelugpa,&rdquo; the sect of virtue, and
whose badge was the yellow cap; for yellow was the
sacred colour of the old Buddhist monks. Among other
precepts he enunciated was the regulation that the virtuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
monks should retreat into solitude at certain times, to give
themselves up to meditation and study, and prepare themselves
for disputations. At the present day the yellow-caps
are much more numerous in Tibet than the red-caps.
Tsong Kapa died in the year 1417, and lies buried in
Galdan, where his sarcophagus or <i>chhorten</i> stands in the
open air. He is regarded as an incarnation of Amitabha,
and at the same time of Manjusri and Vajrapani, and he
still lives on, therefore, in the person of our friend the
present Tashi Lama, after living in the other five Tashi
Lamas in succession, whose graves we have just visited.
No wonder, then, that he is in exceptionally high repute in
Tashi-lunpo.</p>

<p>As we were sitting before the statue, contemplating
Tsong Kapa&rsquo;s kind smiling features under the usual pointed
mitre, young lamas appeared with fruits, sweetmeats, and
tea, and with greetings from the Tashi Lama, who hoped I
would not overtire myself. Some monks sat by the wall
in the semi-darkness reading aloud from their holy scriptures,
which lay before them on small stools; they held in the
hand a <i>dorche</i>, the symbol of power, and a bell which they
rang from time to time (Illustration 130). When we again
went out into the sunshine the Indian elephant of the Tashi
Lama was taking exercise in the lane; he is the only one of
his species in the whole country, and is said to be a present
from a wealthy merchant, who brought him from Siliguri.</p>

<p>The fourth Tashi Lama, Panchen Tenbe Nima (1781-1854)
has also a mausoleum, similar to those of his predecessors.
At either side of the entrance are seen on the
walls of the ante-chamber painted portraits, double life size,
of the &ldquo;four great kings,&rdquo; Namböse, Yukorshung, Pagyepo,
and Chenmigsang, whose duty it is to ward off the demons
and prevent them from disturbing the peace of the temple.
They are painted in staring colours and have a hideous appearance,
are armed with sword, bow, and spear, and surrounded
by a confusion of clouds, waves and tongues of flame,
tigers, dragons, and other wild beasts. These four figures
are hardly ever absent from the entrance to a temple in
Tibet, and one of these four guardian kings is represented
in relief on each of the four sides of the five mausoleums.</p>

<p>Our guides told us that this mausoleum was erected the
same year in which the fourth Tashi Lama died. On
either side of the chapel proper is a smaller shrine, to the
left the Yamiyang-lhakang, with several images, and an
altar front decorated with gilded sphinxes having red wings
on the back, nape of the neck, and paws. On the right
stands the Galdan-lhakang, with an image of Tsong Kapa
projecting from the petals of a lotus flower, which indicates
his heavenly origin.</p>

<p>Lastly, we turn our steps to the chapel in which
the fifth Tashi Lama, Panchen Tenbe Vangchuk (1854-1882)
sleeps his last sleep. As this mausoleum is only
about twenty years old, it looks fresher and cleaner than
the others, and is particularly richly and gorgeously
decorated without and within. The front of the <i>chhorten</i>
glitters with gold, turquoise, and coral. A glass candelabrum
from India looks out of place amid the pure
Lamaist convent style, as also some common balls of
blue glass and looking-glass&mdash;cheap wares, such as are
seen in country gardens and in front of village inns.
They hang from a ledge in front of the sarcophagus
receptacle. On the altar stand the usual votive vessels,
many of them strikingly elegant and tasteful. A large
bowl on a tall foot is of gold, and contains a burning wick.
On the right, on nails, hang simple gifts of poor pilgrims&mdash;cheap
<i>kadakhs</i> like gauze bandages, bangles, necklaces,
amulet cases, rosaries&mdash;all of the cheapest kind, and all
presents from pilgrims who, carried away by their enthusiasm,
offered up the insignificant ornaments they happened
to be wearing. Here we see the impression of a child&rsquo;s
foot on a tablet of stone in a red and yellow frame; a full
description in raised letters informs us that it is the print
of the foot of the present Grand Lama when he was a child
six months old. To this tomb gifts flow more profusely
than to the others, for there are still many people living
who remember the deceased.</p>

<p>The first four tombs were secured by many solid
complicated locks, were opened to admit us, and were
closed again when we left. But the chapel of the fifth
Grand Lama stood open to the public, and a string of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
pilgrims passed to and from it. The monks accompanying
us wished to drive them away, but I would not suffer them
to be disturbed; it was, moreover, interesting to observe
their worship for a while. Murmuring &ldquo;Om mani padme
hum,&rdquo; they stand with bent head before the sepulchral
monument, fall on their knees, let their hands slide forward
over the stone floor until they lie full-length, touching
the ground with their foreheads; then they get up and
repeat this gymnastic feat again and again. Afterwards
they bow before the idols, lay a handful of rice or meal in
the offerings bowls, and go round the dark passage about
the monument.</p>

<p>In each of these monuments the Grand Lama is
interred at the top, in the pyramid behind his own image.
From the street in front of the mausoleums you ascend
some stone steps to a portal which gives access to a paved
forecourt surrounded by a gallery resting on wooden pillars.
Within the pillars the walls are adorned with frescoes
representing smiling gods and dancing goddesses like
nymphs and odalisks, historical and legendary personages,
wild animals, allegorical figures, and the circular disc which
betokens the universe with the worlds of the gods, men,
and devils. The walls in the forecourt of the fifth tomb
were remarkable for the fresh bright colours of their bold
effective decoration, while those in the others had suffered
from the action of time, and in parts were so much
obliterated that they were almost past restoration. When
age has set its mark equally on the whole painted surface
the picture gains in beauty, for its colours are more subdued
and less crude, but the worst is, that frequently the
whole decoration has fallen off. A large bronze bell hangs
in front of each mausoleum.</p>

<p>The outer courts are so small that the elegant portals
cannot exhibit their full beauty; they are too near, and
they are seen much foreshortened. From the outer court
of the fifth tomb a wooden staircase leads up to the
entrance hall; the staircase consists of three divisions, and
has therefore four banisters, the two in the middle being
closed at the top and bottom by ropes. The middle steps
may only be used by the Tashi Lama himself, while those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
at either side are free to Tom, Dick, and Harry, and therefore
are much worn&mdash;almost hollowed out. When the
visitor reaches the top of the staircase, he has the door of
the mausoleum in front of him, and to the right and left the
short sides of the entrance hall, each with a figure of one
of the four spiritual kings, while the two others are painted
on the wall at either side of the massive door-posts. The
entrance hall opens on the forecourt, and its richly carved
lintel and beams are supported by two red polygonal
wooden pillars with carved and painted elongated capitals.
Before the door hangs heavy drapery of a coarse pattern.
The very massive heavy panels of the door are lacquered
dark brick-red, shine like metal, and are ornamented with
mountings, shield-shaped plaques, and rings of yellow brass
partly blackened with age. A pair of tassels hang from
the rings of the shields. When the two doors are opened
the mysterious gloom of the sepulchral chamber and the
flickering lamps are exposed to view (Illustrations 132, 133).</p>

<p>Our first inspection of Tashi-lunpo was now ended, and,
satiated with strange impressions, we betook ourselves in
the twilight to our tents in Kung Gushuk&rsquo;s garden. Darkness
fell sooner than usual, for a storm was gathering in
the west, and it came down on us before we reached our
camp.</p>

<p class="center chap2">POPULAR AMUSEMENTS OF THE TIBETANS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> credulous people at whose expense the monks live in
laziness&mdash;and live well&mdash;are not satisfied with religious
spectacles alone, which minister only to their spiritual
needs; they must also be amused with profane exhibitions,
which are more congenial to their lower instincts, and
are more adapted to stimulate the senses. On February
15 an exhibition of this kind was to take place on the plain
outside the town of Shigatse, and I and my people were
invited. We mounted our horses in good time and rode
northwards through the small town, which has not more
than 300 houses&mdash;towns in Tibet are few and insignificant.
The houses are white, with a black or red band at the top;
with few exceptions they are only one storey high; the
roof is almost always flat and guarded by a parapet; the
windows and doors are in the same style as those of the
monastery. From the street you enter into a yard where
generally a large savage dog is chained. The roofs are
adorned with a forest of bundles of twigs and rods hung
with prayer streamers in all the colours of the rainbow;
their object is to drive away devils. Between the irregular
lines of houses run narrow lanes and roads, where black
swine wallow among the discarded refuse, dead dogs lie
about, and stinking puddles stagnate; and we also pass
open squares, sometimes with ponds.</p>

<p>There is something uniformly dull about the whole
town, in vivid, humiliating contrast to the dzong (Illustration
134), the castle proudly enthroned on its rock, and the golden
temple roofs of Tashi-lunpo at the foot of the mountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
The ground is yellow dust, and here and there we pass
abrupt terraces of löss; dust whirled up by the wind lies
on all the houses and roads.</p>

<p>A black, continuous procession of pleasure-seekers
streams out to the great plain on the north-east of the
dzong; the farther we go the thicker it grows; most are
on foot&mdash;men with prayer mills and tobacco pipes, women
with round red aureoles at the neck and crying children
in their arms, boys, beggars, monks, and all the pilgrims
from neighbouring countries. Here and there rides a fine
gentleman with one or more attendants, while hawkers
transport dried fruit and sweetmeats on mules to sell
among the people.</p>

<p>Arrived at the show-ground, we leave our horses in
charge of Rabsang, and watch with keen interest the
curious festive scene presented to our sight. It is a sea
of human beings, thousands and thousands of Tibetans and
travelling strangers in varied costumes, any one of whom
is a subject worthy of an artist&rsquo;s brush. Before us, to the
east, we have the gardens of the villages at the foot of the
mountains in the Nyang-chu valley, and behind us stretches
a whole town of blue-and-white tents with spectators of
more or less importance, and in the best position stands a
blue-and-white tent open towards the show-ground&mdash;there
sit, cross-legged, on soft rugs, the officials of the dzong in
yellow raiment, solemn as statues of Buddha, and take
refreshments now and again. All these tents rise like
islands above the sea of heads.</p>

<p>Right through the crowd from north to south runs a
race-course, only 6 or 7 feet broad, and flanked on
both sides by ridges of earth a foot high. The ground
slopes down from the canvas town to the course, and the
spectators collected here, ourselves among the number,
have seated themselves in groups; but on the east side,
where the ground is level, they remain standing. And
here the crowd is separated into three divisions by two
broad clear lanes. At the end, close to the race-course,
two targets are erected, consisting of round discs suspended
from poles with a white and a black ring, and a red spot in
the middle. The lanes are kept clear lest any one should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
be hurt during the shooting. Policemen in red-and-white
coats with yellow hats, and pigtails both in front and
behind, keep the people in order; the pigtail swings backwards
and forwards, while a rope&rsquo;s end is in constant use
to drive too inquisitive spectators off the course. Two of
these policemen are attached to me, to keep me a clear view,
but they cause me more annoyance than satisfaction, for I
have constantly to restrain them when they would strike
half-naked youngsters who are not at all in the way.</p>

<p>Now the show commences! All eyes are turned to a
troop of seventy cavaliers in extraordinary motley costumes,
who ride slowly in single file northwards along the race-course,
so slowly that there is plenty of time to examine
the various dresses. All wear red flat mushroom-hats with
waving, drooping plumes, white thin vests with a waistcoat
over them, and white trousers with patches on the knees.
But in some details there is a great variety. One rider,
for instance, is dressed in a white silk waistcoat bound with
black, over a yellow silken jacket with wide rucked sleeves;
while another wears a bright blue jacket on a yellow vest,
and has also blue knee-caps on his yellow pantaloons. In
general the knee patches are red. The quiver, covered
with red material, hangs from a shoulder-belt, and is
decorated with shining metal plates, shields, and buttons,
and contains a bundle of long arrows tipped with single
feathers or tufts. The saddle with its clumsy high wooden
frame rests on a saddle-cloth worked in colours. The tail
of the horse is wrapped round with red, yellow, and blue
ribands terminating in a tassel, which is stretched out by
a ring of wire so as to be more effective. A similar rosette
also adorns the root of the tail, and from it ribands and
cross strips running along the flanks of the horse are
attached to the saddle, and flutter in the wind. Between
the ears the horse carries a towering plume of peacock&rsquo;s
feathers stuck in a bunch of down; on the forehead is a
bundle of strips of material of various lengths and colours;
the bridle is thickly studded with plates of metal, and across
the chest is a broad belt with bells, which ring at the slightest
movement.</p>

<p>The party is therefore decked out fantastically in rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
colours, and now it turns and rides along the course in the
reverse direction, but this time in full career. They ride
as fast as the horses can gallop, fling their legs and elbows
up and down, the plumes wave, the quivers rattle, and all
the tassels, streamers, and ribands fly and flutter in all
directions during this wild career. The horses snort, the
bridles are covered with flakes of froth, and each rider
leaves a cloud of dust for the one behind him. This
evolution is repeated twice, and then at the third lap the
riders shoot with their long bows at the two targets. The
distance between the two is about 60 yards, and an arrow
is aimed at each target. The first shot is easy, but then
the shooter must be very smart in his movements to catch
hold of the quiver, swinging and jumping on his back, take
out the arrow, place it against the string and discharge it
before he is past the second target. Many marksmen hit
both targets, others sent the first arrow into the target, but
the second into the ground. Sometimes the arrow glanced
against the wooden frame of the target, while some of the
riders got over the difficulty by turning round and discharging
the arrows backwards, to the great danger of the
spectators (Illustrations 137, 138).</p>

<p>The horses are small and active, some of them half-wild
and fiery; they have long hair, are badly groomed and
shaggy. During the shooting their legs are at full stretch,
and the reins hang loose on their necks.</p>

<p>At the fourth career the riders shot with loose powder,
and at the fifth with the gun at the first target, and with the
bow at the second. They use long, heavy, clumsy muskets,
and have not even taken off the inconvenient crutch. A
ball of crushed-up paper is inserted in the mouth of the
barrel, which is scattered around when the shot is fired&mdash;to
make a show. The start is made at a considerable
distance, and the rider is at full gallop when he comes
up to the first target. He holds the gun in the left hand,
raises it slowly and gracefully to the right shoulder, grasps
the butt with his right hand, holds the muzzle in front of
him in the direction of the course, and at the moment he is
flying past the target turns the barrel towards it and fires,
the match having been lighted at starting. Many produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
a red cloud from the target, all a white, of paper, if
the gun went off; for it failed when the tinder was not
held at the right moment to the touch-hole. Some marksmen
discharged their guns a little too late, when they were
past the target, and then the spectators most exposed to
danger began to rush away in all directions, for they had
good reason to fear that their eyebrows would be singed.
Immediately the shot is fired the gun-sling is quickly
thrown over the shoulder, and now there are two seconds
in which to catch hold of the quiver, take out an arrow, and
discharge it at the second target. The interval was so
short that most of the riders missed; when one made a hit,
the crowds gave vent to prolonged applause, and a miss
caused still more delight. It must be very hot and trying
work to ride in this gorgeous costume with gun, bow, and
quiver in full sunshine, every now and then buried in a
cloud of dust. Some horses were so restive that their
riders could not shoot, and that caused great amusement
to the people. One of the marksmen loses his hat, and the
next horse shies at it when he is opposite the target, and,
leaving the marked course, springs into the crowd of sightseers.
Another handles his gun well and raises a red cloud
from the target, and also hits the second, but in his hurry
has discharged two arrows. One shatters the target and
another breaks his gun, and rides on with only the butt in
his raised hand, all to the great amusement of the people.
Attendants collect the arrows, repair the targets, and fill in
the bull&rsquo;s eyes with fresh powder (Illustration 138).</p>

<p>This is a Tibetan popular diversion, fresh, rich in
colouring, and picturesque. The spectators have evidently
their favourites among the competitors, as may be gathered
from the increased buzz of voices when certain cavaliers
draw near. Others are not expected to win laurels, for
they are received with bursts of laughter. The people are
all eyes and ears as they stand or sit for hours together,
eating nuts and sweet stuff. In the crowd we see many
old acquaintances from the monastery, and also lamas from
Ladak, who are studying in the theological seminaries of
Tashi-lunpo; merchants from Nepal and Bhotan, Mongolian
pilgrims in fur caps with large ear-flaps of fox-skin, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
about a score of merchants from Ladak and Kashmir, in
tall white turbans and black kaftans with waist-belts. The
Chinese, who play the same part in Tibet as the English in
India, sit in small groups, smoking their pipes; they seem
to take no interest in the prize-shooting. They wear blue
dresses, black vests, and black skull-caps with a coral
button on the top.</p>

<p>Two horses, which probably had never before taken part
in such sports, took fright, rushed among the crowd on our
side, knocking down some and jumping over others, and
were caught at length when they had fallen down entangled
in human bodies and clothing. Last of all, a ragged fellow
jolted along the course on a wretched brute, causing great
merriment. This was the signal that the sports were
ended, and now the riders dismounted and passed in a long
procession before the dzong tent, where each bowed his
head before the &ldquo;Chairman of the Town Council,&rdquo; and a
<i>kadakh</i> was laid over his neck. This inexpensive mark of
favour was also bestowed on them by their friends and
acquaintances, and some favourites went about with as
many as sixty white neck-cloths. I treated the whole
party to tea, and gave them a present of money for the
amusement they had afforded myself and my retinue.
When we at last rode into Shigatse, we were escorted by
quite a host of black Tibetans.</p>

<p>On February 21 Ma Daloi invited me to witness some
performances in the inner court of his <i>yamen</i> in commemoration
of the Chinese New Year. The performers were
to be soldiers of the garrison, but the spectacle was put on
the stage by the four Chinese temples in Shigatse. It was
late at night and pitch dark, and the whole effect depended
on the illumination. Two chairs with a table between them
were placed in the verandah, and while Ma regaled me with
genuine Chinese tea, cakes, and cigarettes, twenty men
entered, each carrying two large lanterns of white material
in the form of a clover leaf, and painted with flowers and
dragons. In the centre a wick is so fixed, that the lanterns
do not catch fire when they are swung round. The men
dance, and swing their lanterns in an advancing line of
uniform undulations; they then place themselves so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
the lanterns form various patterns, constantly changing;
they whirl themselves round with lightning speed, and the
bright lanterns resemble great fireballs hovering about in
the darkness. All the time squibs and crackers are thrown
about, and fizz and explode among the legs of the spectators,
for the court is full of Tibetans who come in quite at their
ease. Lastly, the lanterns are left standing and a gigantic
bird with a long movable tail and a long curved neck
stalks solemnly across the court. The next item is performed
by Nepalese. Each of them carries two lanterns
like beehives; the top of the one in front consists of a
horse&rsquo;s head, with a full flowing mane of paper, and at the
point of the hinder hangs a paper tail. Therefore they
seem to be riding on horses illuminated from within, as
they execute a very lively dance round the court. They
sing all the while a melancholy song in slow time. And
now a green and yellow dragon comes writhing on to the
scene. His head is of wood and paper, and is borne by
a man from whose back a painted cloth, the body of the
dragon, hangs down and envelops a second crouching
man. The dragon dances, twists itself about, opens its
jaws, and makes as though it would swallow all present.
During the play, weird noisy music drones from drums,
cymbals, and flutes, which produce notes like those of a bagpipe.
These buffoons present themselves in the courts of
all people of rank during the New Year season, to make a
little money. They threatened us one evening, but I
begged them to come in the daytime, that I might immortalize
them on a photographic plate (Illustration 136).</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXVIII</p>

<p class="center chap2">MONKS AND PILGRIMS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">During</span> the period of forty-seven days which the force of
circumstances compelled me to spend in Shigatse, I had an
opportunity of making numerous visits to the monastery,
of drawing and photographing interesting details, of
making myself familiar with the daily life and habits of
the monks, being present at their studies and recitations,
and ever increasing my knowledge of the hierarchical
metropolis. I used to ride up to Tashi-lunpo with one
or two attendants, and pass the whole day in its dark
sepulchral chapels and temples. At twilight some of my
men came for me with horses. I will recall a few of the
impressions I received on these visits, before we start again
on our travels.</p>

<p>On February 14 I sat on the uppermost of the western
galleries and drew a sketch of the façade of the eastern
tomb (Illustration 124), but the pilgrims who were assembling
this day for a religious spectacle proved so inquisitive
that I had to stop my work and postpone it till a more
favourable occasion. I then ascended to a roof platform
in front of the Labrang, protected with a balustrade, and
posted sentinels at the foot of the steps to prevent the
people from following me. Up there the eye falls on a
number of cylindrical frames, a couple of yards high, some
covered with black and white materials, others enveloped
in folded draperies of different colours and length, very like
petticoats (Illustration 109). Between them gilded tridents,
flagstaffs, and other holy symbols protrude, which protect
the temples from demons. While I was sketching a view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
of the façades of the middle three mausoleums, the head
steward of Tashi-lunpo appeared, who supervises the provisioning,
cleaning and lighting, etc., caused rugs and
cushions to be laid down, and set out the usual refreshments.
He is an old lama who has already served thirty
years in Tashi-lunpo, after preparatory studies in the
monastery Tösang-ling.</p>

<p>From our point of view we can see several smaller
gilded copper roofs in Chinese style, standing in front of
the façades of the mausoleums and rising directly from
flat roofs without any intervening course. Under each
roof is ensconced an idol of importance in a temple hall.</p>

<p>We moved about on the roof and enjoyed the wonderful
view over the cloister town and its forest of roof
ornaments, and came to a place where groups of clerical
tailors were sewing together pieces of coloured materials
with a zeal and despatch as if their lives depended on it.
Had it not been for the religious environment and the
waving emblems, one might have thought that they were
busy with dresses for a ballet or masquerade. Oh, no,
the idols were to have new silken dresses, and were to be
hung round with new draperies and standards in honour of
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the birth of the Tashi Lama.
The clerical knights of the needle sat in the full sunshine,
sewed, chattered together, and seemed quite happy. They
boldly asked me for money to buy tea, and I gave them a
handful of rupees.</p>

<p>Below the place where we had first seen the Tashi
Lama at the performance, lies an open gallery, a colonnade
looking on the court; the pillars are of wood, and are
wound round with red stuff at the top and white below.
This gallery is very picturesque, especially the part where
the statues of the four spirit kings are placed. The pillars
stand out dark against the light background of the open
court, and among them move figures which are far from
marring the picture, namely, monks in red garments and
pilgrims in motley attire (Illustration 142).</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">138. <span class="sc">Popular Diversion in Shigatse.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Now, too, a religious ceremony was being held in the
court. A kind of throne was erected on the northern, shorter,
side, and on both sides of it sat monks in yellow kaftans.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
Two lamas, also clothed in yellow, advanced bare-headed
to the throne and remained there motionless with their
bodies bent. Then three lamas in red togas and yellow
skull-caps walked slowly over the quadrangle with shrill
cries and singular gestures, took off their caps and put
them on again with mystical movements. This ceremony
was continued so long that we followed the example of most
of the pilgrims and left the clergy to their own devices.</p>

<p>Next day another ceremony took place, of which,
unfortunately, I could obtain no trustworthy explanation.
The Tashi Lama took his seat on the throne of yellow silk,
on the short side of the court, in full pontificals, and two
monks in red dresses came before him in tall red helmet-shaped
head-coverings. After His Holiness had greeted
them, one advanced to the eleven steps of the stone staircase
and stationed himself on the lowest, whereupon a very
curious conversation began. The lama on the step calls
out something, probably a quotation from the holy scriptures,
or, perhaps, puts a question, claps his hands so that
the court rings with the sound, and makes a movement
with the right hand as though he were throwing something
straight at the head of the other monk. This one replies
in the same loud tone and also claps his hands. Occasionally
the Tashi Lama puts in a word himself. Lobsang
Tsering, who is with me, says that this ceremony is a kind
of disputation, and that the two disputing monks will attain
a higher degree in the scale of the priesthood if they pass
the examination satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Below, to our left, six monks in yellow garments sit on a
carpet. Between the pillars the gallery is packed with
lamas of lower rank in red dresses, and before them sit
superior monks in red kaftans richly worked in gold.
Beside the Tashi Lama, on his right, is the seat of Lobsang
Tsundo Gyamtso. The dark-red and straw-yellow robes are
very effective against the dirty-grey colour of the court.</p>

<p>Now a number of serving brothers come on the scene
and set long rows of small tables on the open space in front
of the Tashi Lama, which are immediately covered with
bowls of dried fruits, confectionery, and mandarin oranges.
And now begins a feast in honour of the graduation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
When the tables and bowls are emptied, they are removed
as quickly as they were brought, and then comes a solemn
procession of monks with tea-pots, and a kind of tea
ceremony begins, less complicated but quite as imposing
as in Japan. Two priests of high rank place themselves
in front of the Tashi Lama and remain there, bending a
little forwards, and quite as motionless as the priests praying
at the altar in our own churches. It is their duty to serve
tea to His Holiness. The first monk in the procession
bears a pot of solid gold, which one of the monks before
the throne takes from him to fill the cup of the Tashi
Lama. The other monks in the procession carry silver
pots, each of which is valued at £45, and from these tea is
poured out for all the other monks who are not re-incarnations.
Every monk carries his own wooden cup in the
folds of his toga, and holds it out when the monk who
pours out the tea comes round with his pot (Illust. 143).</p>

<p>All through the ceremony the two candidates continue
to dispute and clap their hands without intermission.
After sitting cross-legged for three hours, as motionless as
a statue of Buddha, His Holiness leaves the throne, and,
supported by two monks, slowly descends the staircase, on
which a narrow strip of coloured carpet is laid; for the
Tashi Lama may not touch the unclean earth with his holy
feet. Behind him walks a monk, holding above his head a
huge sunshade of yellow silk with hanging fringes. One
can hardly help feeling that the little man in papal robes
and the yellow mitre, who disappears in the darkness
among the pillars of the gallery, while the deepest silence
prevails, is really a saint, and one of the most powerful in
the world. He is now going up to his apartments in the
Labrang, where he can pass his time in peace till some new
ceremony calls him forth to discharge his ecclesiastical
duties (Illust. 145).</p>

<p>A gloom seemed to fall over the whole quadrangle
after he had withdrawn. The monks, who had but just
been so quiet, began to talk and laugh, the younger ones
played and wrestled together, and dirty bare-armed novices
drove away with sticks two mangy dogs which had found
their way into the holy place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span></p>

<p>It was, however, not only the absence of the Tashi
Lama that relieved the gloom of the quadrangle: clouds of
yellow dust were being swept by a westerly storm over
Tashi-lunpo. All the streamers, window curtains and
awnings, and the long white flags, began to flutter and clap,
and the strokes of the thousand temple bells were blended
into one clang, which filled the air and seemed to rise like a
hymn to the dwellings of the gods; for at all corners, projections,
and cornices are hung brazen bells with clappers
attached to a spring, so that a very slight breeze is sufficient
to produce a sound. It is very pleasant to listen to this
great carillon played by the wind as one wanders through
the maze of Tashi-lunpo.</p>

<p>A lama from Ladak, who had been studying for five
years in Tashi-lunpo, informed me that there are four
different grades of learned priests. If there are several
sons in one family, one must always be devoted to the
monastic life. In order to be received into a monastery he
must first take the oath, binding him to live in chastity and
abstinence, not to drink, to steal, to kill, etc. He is then
admitted as a novice into the fraternity of the yellow
monks. After preliminary studies he attains to the first order
in the priesthood, which is called the <i>Getsul</i>, and it is his
duty to study certain holy writings and listen to the
instruction imparted by a Kanpo-Lama. He is also bound
to perform certain services, present tea to the superior
monks, carry wood and water, see after the cleaning of
the temples, fill the votive bowls, snuff the butter lamps,
etc. The next order, the <i>Gelong</i>, has three subdivisions:
<i>Ringding</i>, <i>Rikchen</i>, and <i>Kachen</i>, of which the last qualifies
a member to act as teacher. Then comes the rank of
<i>Kanpo-Lama</i>, or abbot, and lastly the <i>Yungchen</i>, who
stands next to the Panchen Rinpoche.</p>

<p>The Getsul-Lama has to pay a fee of 20 rupees in
order to be promoted to the rank of a Ringding-Lama; it
is only a question of money, and the rank may be conferred
on a monk a month after he enters the convent, but may be
postponed for years if he is penniless. A Ringding-Lama
must study a great number of scriptures and pay 50 or 60
rupees before he can become a Rikchen-Lama, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
300 to become a Kachen. According to another informant
the Ringding and the Rikchen are attached to the Getsul
order, and only the Kachen belongs to the Gelong order.
In these orders, however, it is easier to collect the necessary
fees, for the monk has now an opportunity of exercising
his sacerdotal office among the people. No payment is
demanded on promotion to the rank of Kanpo-Lama, but
this appointment is in the hands of the Tashi Lama; it is
comparatively seldom conferred, and great learning is a
necessary condition. On his appointment the lama receives
a certificate bearing the seal of the Tashi Lama. A
thorough knowledge of the holy books is required for the
rank of Yungchen, and a conclave of high priests present
recommendations for the conferment of the dignity.</p>

<p>At the present time there are 3800 monks in Tashi-lunpo,
but during festivals the number rises to 5000, for
then many come in from the neighbouring convents. Of
the 3800 there are, it is said, 2600 of the Getsul and 1200
of the Gelong order. The Gelong Lamas are not obliged
to meddle with worldly matters, but have only to superintend
the temple services and take part in the rites. There
are four only of the Kanpo order now in Tashi-lunpo and
two of the Yungchen: one from the Chang province, and
the other from Kanum in Beshar, the convent where the
Hungarian Alexander Csoma Körösi lived as a monk eighty
years ago in order to study the records of Lamaism. This
Yungchen-Lama, who is named Lotsaba, is abbot of the
monastery Kanum and of three others near the Sutlej. He
came as a nine-year-old boy to Tashi-lunpo, and has lived
here twenty-nine years. He longs to return to his home,
but the Tashi Lama will not let him go thither until the
Dalai Lama has returned to Lhasa.</p>

<p>Of the 3800 monks, 400 in all come from Ladak and
other lands in the western Himalayas; a few are Mongolians
and the rest Tibetans; 240 monks provide the
church music, and dancing is performed by 60. They
dance only twice a year. In the intervals their valuable
costumes are deposited in sealed chests in a store-room
called Ngakang. As they are little worn they last for
centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span></p>

<p>The disputation just described is connected with promotion
to the Kachen order, the graduation taking place
only during the New Year festival, when eighteen lamas
are annually promoted from the rank of Getsul to that of
Gelong. The ceremony lasts three days: on the first day
two graduate in the morning and two in the afternoon; on
the second day six, and on the third day eight.</p>

<p>On February 16 I again rode up to the monastery to
sketch gateways and photograph the Tashi Lama, who had
sent me word in the morning that this day would suit him
if I had time to spare. The weather was all that could be
wished, calm and clear. There was a dense crowd on the
uppermost platform, in a broad open space before the
eastern mausoleum. It was particularly interesting to see
an interminable procession of nuns, who had come in from
the neighbouring temples to seek the blessing of the Tashi
Lama for the new year. All ages were represented, from
wrinkled old women to quite young girls. They were fearfully
ugly and dirty, and in the whole collection I could find
only two who were fairly good-looking. They had short
hair and were dressed like the monks: some I should have
taken for men, if I had not known that they were women.
But, unlike the monks, they wore small yellow caps with
turned-up brims, red on the underside.</p>

<p>Lamas and pilgrims swarmed on the courts, platforms,
roofs, and staircases&mdash;all come to receive the sacred blessing;
the devout and patient assembly, here forming queues, made
a deep impression on the spectators. To us they intimated
a long wait, and therefore we went to the tomb of the
Grand Lama, and I drew the handsome portal. I had
scarcely finished when Tsaktserkan appeared to inform me
that His Holiness was waiting for me, so we hurried up
the staircases, past the usual groups of monks, who were
loitering all about and appeared to have little to do. On
the great quadrangle preparations were being made for the
disputation ceremonies.</p>

<p>This time Muhamed Isa accompanied me, and the
Tashi Lama received me in the same half-open roof
chamber as on the former occasion. He was as charming
as ever, and again turned the conversation to distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
countries far remote from this carefully isolated Tibet.
This time he spoke chiefly of Agra, Benares, Peshawar,
Afghanistan, and the road from Herat to the Khyber Pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What lies to the west of Yarkand?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pamir and Turkestan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And west of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Caspian Sea, which is navigated by large
steamers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And west of the Caspian Sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Caucasus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where do you come to when you continue to
travel westwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Black Sea, Turkey, Russia, Austria, Germany,
France, and then to England, which lies out in the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is there to the west of this ocean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;America, and beyond another ocean, and then Japan,
China, and Tibet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world is immensely large,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully,
and nodded to me with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>I asked him to come to Sweden, where I would be his
guide. Then he smiled again: he would like to travel to
Sweden and London, but high sacred duties kept him constantly
fettered to the convent walls of Tashi-lunpo.</p>

<p>After tea and refreshments he walked about his room
like an ordinary man, and asked me to get my camera
ready. A yellow carpet was laid in the sunny part of the
room, and a chair was placed on it. He did not, alas! wear
his refined, charming smile when the three plates were exposed,
but had a solemn look&mdash;perhaps he was considering
whether it might not be dangerous to allow an unbeliever
to take his portrait in the midst of his own cloister town
(Illustration 146). A tall young lama with a pleasant
countenance knew how to take photographs, and took a
couple of portraits of me for the Tashi Lama. He had
a dark room, where we could develop our plates&mdash;Lamaist
temples are excellently adapted for dark rooms.</p>

<p>Then we resumed our seats, and the Tashi Lama
inquired how I had liked the show of riders on the preceding
day. I answered that I had never experienced
such amusement. He had never attended these worldly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
spectacles, for he was always engaged in his religious duties
on that day. Then he made a sign, and some monks
brought in a gift of honour for me: two bundles of cerise-coloured
woollen material, woven in Gyangtse; some pieces
of gold-embroidered stuff from China; two copper bowls
with silver edges, and a gilded saucer for a porcelain cup,
with a cover to match. With his own hands he gave me
a gilded image clothed in red and yellow silk, and a large
light-yellow <i>kadakh</i>. The image he gave me, a seated
Buddha with blue hair, a crown, and a bowl in the hands,
from which a plant sprouts, he called Tsepagmed. This,
according to Grünwedel, is the form of the Amitabha
Buddha, called Amitayus, or &ldquo;he who has an immeasurably
long life.&rdquo; It is significant that the Tashi Lama
selected this particular image to give me, for he is himself
an incarnation of Amitabha, and he is almighty. The
figure of the Tsepagmed was therefore intended as a
pledge that a long life was before me. This I did not
understand at the time; it was only when I looked through
Professor Grünwedel&rsquo;s <i>Mythologie</i> that I grasped the
significance of the present.</p>

<p>This time the audience lasted two and a half hours, and
it was the last time I saw the Tashi Lama face to face;
for afterwards all sorts of political complications arose
which might have been dangerous to him&mdash;not to me&mdash;and
I considered myself bound not to expose him to any
annoyance through my visits, which might excite the
suspicion of the Chinese. But it grieved me to stay
near him for weeks, knowing that he saw every day my
tent from his small cloister window, and yet not be able to
visit and converse with him; for he was one of those
rare, refined, and noble personalities who make other people
feel that their lives are fuller and more precious. Yes, the
memory of the Tashi Lama will cleave to me as long as I
live. His friendship is sincere, his shield is spotless and
bright, he seeks for the truth honestly and humbly, and
knows that by a virtuous and conscientious life he renders
himself a worthy temple for the soul of the mighty
Amitabha.</p>

<p>The Tashi Lama was six years old when destiny called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
him to be the Pope of Tashi-lunpo, a dignity he has held
nineteen years. He is said to have been born in Tagbo,
in the Gongbo country. He, like the Pope, is a prisoner
in the Tibetan Vatican in spite of his great religious influence,
and leads a life prescribed by religious regulations,
every day of the year having its particular ecclesiastical
functions and occupations. For instance, on February 20,
he must bow the knee before the graves of all his predecessors,
accompanied by all the superior clergy. When
I asked where he himself would be interred when it pleased
Amitabha to be re-incarnated in a new Tashi Lama, I was
told that a sepulchre would be erected for him as handsome
as the others, and that a conclave of the higher
priests would select the site. Either the sixth mausoleum
will be erected on the west side of the others in a line with
them, or a new row will be commenced in front of the
former.</p>

<p>One day all my Lamaist followers were admitted to the
presence of His Holiness. It was agreed beforehand that
they should not pay more as temple offerings than three
rupees per man. Of course I paid for them, and they
afterwards assured me that the sacred blessing would
benefit them during the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>I did not succeed in getting information as to the
number of pilgrims who flock annually to Tashi-lunpo.
When I made inquiries on the subject I was answered with
a laugh, and the statement that they were so numerous it
was quite impossible to count them. Pilgrims of rank and
fortune make large contributions; others only a small silver
coin, or a bag of <i>tsamba</i> or rice; and others again come in
companies in the train of some well-to-do chief who pays
for them all. If the concourse is too large, the blessing is
imparted by the higher monks through laying on of hands;
when the numbers are smaller, they receive the blessing
from the Tashi Lama himself, not with the hand, but with
a staff bound with yellow silk. He only blesses people of
position and monks with his hand.</p>

<p>We saw laymen as well as clergy among the pilgrims.
We have already seen the nuns forming a queue and
waiting for the blessing. Four hundred nuns had come in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
from the neighbouring convents. During their stay they
receive free lodging in the Chini-chikang, a building in
Tashi-lunpo, free board, and a small present of money at
their departure. They do not appear every year, but this
year they arrived on the second day of the festival and
departed on February 18.</p>

<p>We also saw novices from other monasteries, who are
regaled with tea at stated times; but they must be content
to sit on the ground in front of the kitchen, where they fill
the narrow lane, so that it is difficult to get past.</p>

<p>There are also wandering lamas among the pilgrims.
One day I made a sketch of one who had roamed far and
wide. He wore a rosary round his neck, a necklace of
shells, and a <i>gao</i> with an idol, which had been given him
by the Tashi Lama. Not long before he had performed
a prostration pilgrimage round all the monasteries of
Lhasa, and had just completed this feat, so acceptable to
the gods, round Tashi-lunpo. He moves in the direction
of the hands of a watch, and measures the distance round
the monastery with the length of his body. He folds his
hands over his forehead, sinks on his knees, lays himself
full length on the ground, stretches both arms forward,
scratches a mark in the soil, stands up, steps up to the
mark and falls again on his knees, and repeats this process
till he has gone all round the monastery. Such a circuit of
Tashi-lunpo demands a whole day, but if he also goes into
the lanes and round all the mausoleums and temples, this
religious gymnastic feat requires three days. We saw daily
whole rows both of clerical and lay pilgrims encompassing
Tashi-lunpo and all its gods in this fashion. I asked
several of them how many times they prostrated themselves
on the ground during a circuit, but they did not
know; for, they said, &ldquo;We pray all the time, Om mani
padme hum; there are twenty manis to each prostration,
and we cannot therefore count the prostrations as well.&rdquo;
Many of them encircle the wall several times.</p>

<p>This wandering lama was one of a brotherhood of nine
monks, who often visited us in our garden, sat down in
front of the tents, turned their prayer mills, and sang.
They had free lodging in a building in Tashi-lunpo, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
Hamdung. Another member was the seventeen-year-old
Tensin from Amdo, who had taken four months to
travel thence to Tashi-lunpo. They had come for the
festival, and intended to return home through Lhasa
and Nakchu (Illustration 216).</p>

<p>The contributions of the pilgrims are one of Tashi-lunpo&rsquo;s
chief sources of revenue. But the monastery also
possesses extensive estates and herds, and certain monks,
who superintend the agricultural affairs and have the disposal
of the produce, also carry on trade with the neighbourhood
and with Nepal. The produce of the whole of
Chang is devoted to the use of Tashi-lunpo, which is therefore
wealthy. Each of the 3800 monks, irrespective of
rank, receives 15 rupees annually, and, of course, lives
gratis in the convent.</p>

<p>Another large source of income is the sale of amulets,
talismans and relics, idols of metal or terra cotta, sacred
paintings (<i>tankas</i>), joss-sticks, etc. The priests also get
very good prices for small, insignificant, almost worthless
clay idols, and paper strips with symbolical figures, which
the pilgrims carry round the neck as talismans, when these
things have been duly blessed by the Tashi Lama.</p>

<p>On February 21 I spent nearly the whole day in parts
of the monastery I had not previously seen. We wandered
through narrow winding corridors, and lanes in deep shadow,
between tall white-washed stone houses, in which the
monks have their cells. One of the houses was inhabited
by student monks from the environs of Leh, Spittok, and
Tikze, and we went into the small dark cubicles, hardly
larger than my tent. Along one of the longer sides stood
the bed, a red-covered mattress, a pillow, and a frieze
blanket. The other furniture consisted of some boxes of
books, clothing, and religious articles. Holy writings lay
opened. A couple of bags contained <i>tsamba</i> and salt, a
small altar with idols, votive vessels, and burning butter
lamps, and that is all. Here it is dark, cool, damp, and
musty&mdash;anything but agreeable; very like a prison. But
here the man who has consecrated his life to the Church,
and stands on a higher level than other men, spends his
days. Monks of lower rank live two or three in one cell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
Gelongs have cells to themselves, and the chief prelates
have much more elegant and spacious apartments.</p>

<p>Each monk receives daily three bowls of <i>tsamba</i>, and
takes his meals in his own cell, where tea also is brought
to him three times a day. But tea is also handed round
during the services in the temple halls, in the lecture-rooms,
and in the great quadrangle. No religious rite
seems to be too holy to be interrupted at a convenient
time by a cup of tea.</p>

<p>One day from the red colonnade (Kabung) I looked
down on the court full of lamas, who were sitting in small
groups, leaving only narrow passages free, along which
novices passed to and fro with hot silver and copper pots,
and offered the soup-like beverage stirred up with butter.
It had all the appearance of a social &ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock tea&rdquo;
after some service. But the meeting had a certain touch
of religion, for occasionally a solemn, monotonous hymn
was sung, which sounded wonderfully beautiful and affecting
as it reverberated through the enclosed court. On
March 4 the quadrangle and other places within the walls
of Tashi-lunpo swarmed with women&mdash;it was the last day
on which the precincts of the monastery were open to
them; they would not be admitted again till the next
Losar festival (Illustration 150).</p>

<p>The young monk who, when accompanying the Tashi
Lama in India, had had an opportunity of learning about
photography, had his dark room beside his large elegant
cell. I, too, was able to develop my plates there. He
asked me to come frequently and give him instructions.
He had solid tables, comfortable divans, and heavy handsome
hangings in his room, which was lighted with oil
lamps at night. There we sat and talked for hours. All
of a sudden he took it into his head to learn English. We
began with the numerals, which he wrote down in Tibetan
characters; after he had learned these by heart he asked
for other of the more common words. However, he
certainly made no striking progress during the few lessons
I gave him.</p>

<p>Care is necessary in walking through the streets of the
cloister town, for the flags, which have been trod by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
thousands of monks for hundreds of years, are worn smooth
and are treacherous. Usually there is a good deal of
traffic, especially on feast days. Monks come and go,
stand talking in groups at the street-corners and in the
doorways, pass to and from the services, or are on their
way to visit their brethren in their cells; others carry newly-made
banners and curtains from the tailor&rsquo;s shop into the
mystical twilight of the gods; while others bear water-cans
to fill the bowls on the altars, or sacks of meal and rice
for the same purpose. Small trains of mules come to fill
the warehouse of the convent, where a brisk business is
going on, for a family of 3800 has to be provided for.
And then, again, there are pilgrims, who loiter about here
only to look in on the gods, swing their prayer mills, and
murmur their endless &ldquo;Om mani padme hum.&rdquo; Here and
there along the walls beggars are sitting, holding out their
wooden bowls for the passer-by to place something in, if it
is only a pinch of <i>tsamba</i>. The same emaciated, ragged
beggars are to be found daily at the same street-corners,
where they implore the pity of the passengers in the same
whining, beseeching tone. In the narrow lanes, where
large prayer mills are built in rows into the wall, and are
turned by the passers-by, many poor people are seated,
a living reproof of the folly of believing that the turning of
a prayer mill alone is a sufficiently meritorious action on
the way to the realms of the blessed. In one particularly
small room stand two colossal cylindrical prayer mills
before which a crowd is always collected&mdash;monks, pilgrims,
merchants, workmen, tramps and beggars. Such a praying
machine contains miles of thin paper strips with
prayers printed on them, and wound round and round the
axis of the cylinder. There is a handle attached, by which
the axle can be turned. A single revolution, and millions
of prayers ascend together to the ears of the gods.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Immediately</span> below the red colonnade stands the Sokchin-rungkang-chimbo,
the kitchen, with its walled-up stove of
colossal dimensions and six huge caldrons embedded in
masonry. The first supplies all the 3800 monks with tea
at one boiling. On the part of the caldron which rises
above the masonry are inscriptions and cast ornaments
(Illustration 141). Each caldron has a wooden cover which
is put on when the caldron is not in use. Tea was being
prepared in two of these gigantic pots; probably allowance
was made for any chance guests. Glowing, blazing fireplaces
yawn below the caldrons, and faggots of branches
and sticks are thrust in with long iron forks. There is an
opening in the roof for the smoke, which rises up in grey
rings and produces a picturesque illumination in the holy
kitchen. A continuous succession of young lamas and
workmen ascend the steps leading up from the street,
carrying on their backs water-tubs of different capacity
according to the strength of the bearer; for there are quite
small boys among them, who have recently been consigned
by their relations to the care of the monks. One after
another tips his tub over the edge of the caldron, while the
stoker thrusts fresh faggots of wood into the stove. Other
serving brothers bring in a quantity of cubes of brick tea
which they throw into the boiling water, whence clouds of
steam ascend and mingle with the smoke. At the side of
the caldron stand two cooks, who stir with huge staves
larger than oars, and disappear in the rising steam, becoming
visible again, like shadow figures lighted from above,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
when a slight draught from the door clears the air. They
sing a slow rhythmical song over their work.</p>

<p>When the tea is ready, it is poured into large bright
copper pots with shining yellow brass mountings, handles,
and all kinds of ornamentation. Novices carry the vessels
on their shoulders to all the various halls and cells. A loud
signal is given on a sea-shell from a temple roof that the
monks may not miss their tea, but may be on the look-out.
I frequently looked into the kitchen, the scene was so
picturesque, and the cooks were ready for a joke and were
not averse to being sketched (Illustration 148).</p>

<p>Two large and several small <i>chhortens</i> are erected on an
open square in front of the mausoleums, of exactly the same
design as those so frequently seen in Ladak. There are
also stone niches filled with idols and other objects. A
crowd of people was collected on the terrace when I was
sketching, and it was not easy to get a clear view. It was
a striking picture, with all the red and many-coloured
garments against the background of the white-washed
walls of the memorial towers (Illustration 151).</p>

<p>One day when I had sat a long time talking in the cell
of the photographing lama, it was dark when I went home.
We passed, as we often had before, the entrance gate to
the forecourt of the Namgyal-lhakang, the temple in which
the Tashi Lama had once provided us with refreshments.
There the evening service was in full swing, and of course
we entered to look on. The illumination was more dimly
religious than usual, but we could at any rate make out our
surroundings after coming straight out of the outer darkness.
The monks sat on long red divans, and their black
profiles were thrown up by the row of forty flames burning
in bowls before the altar. The gilded lotus blossoms of
the pedestal were brightly lighted, and the yellow silken
scarves in the hands of Tsong Kapa&rsquo;s statue and the garlands
draped over the images stood out conspicuously.
But the upper parts of the figures under the roof were
plunged in darkness, and Tsong Kapa&rsquo;s countenance, with
plump rosy cheeks and broad nose, was so curiously lighted
up from below that his smile was not perceptible. The
four coloured pillars in the middle of the hall appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
black against the altar lamps. The monks wore yellow
robes, sat bare-headed, and chanted their melancholy
litanies, now and then interrupted by ringing of bells
and the roll of drums. At first the leather head of the
drumstick falls slowly and regularly on the tight skin, then
the beats become more and more frequent, and at last the
drum becomes silent in an instant. A monk recites &ldquo;Om
mani padme hum&rdquo; in rising and falling tones with the
rapidity of an expert, and the others join in, making some
kind of responses. The recitation passes into a continuous
hum, in which often only the words &ldquo;Om mani&rdquo; are heard
aloud, and the word &ldquo;Lama&rdquo; uttered more slowly. The
whole ritual has a singularly soporific effect; only Tsong
Kapa listens attentively, sitting dreamily with wide staring
eyes, and ears hanging down to the shoulders. Here, too,
the indispensable tea is handed round; a monk with an
oil lamp attends the server that he may be able to see the
cups. The monks were now quite accustomed to my
visits and took no particular notice of me, but they always
greeted me politely and asked what I had been sketching
during the day.</p>

<p>A lama gave me information about a remarkable
custom. Certain monks consent of their own free will to
be walled up in dark grottoes or caves for the space of three,
six, or at most twelve years. Near a small monastery,
Shalu-gompa, a day&rsquo;s journey from Tashi-lunpo, there is
a monk who has already spent five years in his grotto, and
is to remain there seven more. In the wall of the grotto
is an opening a span in diameter. When the twelve years
are over, and the hermit may return to the light of day, he
crawls out through this opening. I insinuated that this
was a physical impossibility, but the lama replied that the
miracle does take place, and, besides, the enclosed monk
has become so emaciated in the twelve years that he can
easily slip through the opening. One of the monks of the
monastery goes daily to the grotto with tea, water, and
<i>tsamba</i>, and pushes these provisions through the opening,
but he may not speak to the prisoner or the charm would
be broken. Only sufficient light penetrates through the
opening to allow the anchorite to distinguish between day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
and night. To read the holy scriptures, which he has taken
with him into the cave, he must use an oil lamp, and a
fresh supply of oil is placed from time to time in the
opening. He says his prayers all day long, and divides
the night into three watches, of which two are spent in
sleep and one in reading. During the twelve years he
may not once leave his grotto, never look at the sun, and
never kindle a fire. His clothing is not the usual monk&rsquo;s
dress, but a thin cotton shirt, and a girdle round the body;
he wears no trousers, head-covering, or shoes.</p>

<p>Among other abstruse subjects, this penitent must study
a composition on some kind of magic, which renders him
insensible to cold and almost independent of the laws of
gravity. He becomes light, and when the hour of release
arrives, travels on winged feet: whereas he used to take
ten days to journey from Tashi-lunpo to Gyangtse, he can
now cover the distance in less than a day. Immediately
the twelve years of trial are ended, he must repair to
Tashi-lunpo to blow a blast of a horn on the roof, and
then he returns to Shalu-gompa. He is considered a
saint as long as he lives, and has the rank of a Kanpo-Lama.
No sooner has he left his grotto than another is
ready to enter the darkness and undergo the same test.
This lama was the only one in this neighbourhood then
confined in a grotto, but there are hermits in abundance,
living in open caves or small stone huts, and maintained
by the nomads living near them. We were later on to
hear of fanatical lamas who renounce the world in a much
stricter fashion.</p>

<p>In Tashi-lunpo the cloister rule seems to be strictly
enforced: there are especial inspectors, policemen and
lictors who control the lives of the monks in their cells
and take care that no one commits a breach of his vows.
Recently a monk had broken the vow of chastity; he was
ejected for ever from the Gelugpa confraternity and banished
from the territory of Tashi-lunpo. He has, then, no prospect
of finding an asylum in another monastery, but must
embrace some secular profession.</p>

<p>One day we visited the Dena-lhakang, a temple like
a half-dark corridor, for it is lighted only by two quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
inadequate windows. In the middle of the corridor there
is a niche which has doors into the hall, for the walls are
very thick. Thus between the doors and the window is
formed a small room in which the lama on duty sits as in
a hut. He belongs to the Gelong order, is named Tung
Shedar, came from Tanak, and is now seventy years old,
has short white hair, and a skin as dry as an old yellow
crumpled parchment.</p>

<p>On entering, one sees on the right a bookcase with deep
square pigeon-holes, in which holy books are placed. On
the outer, longer wall, banners painted with figures hang
between the two windows, in the deepest shadow, most of
which are of venerable age, and are dusty and faded&mdash;a
Lamaist picture gallery. Pillars are ranged along the
longer wall, of red lacquered wood, and between them is
suspended trellis-work of short iron rods, forming geometrical
figures. They are intended to preserve the
valuables from theft. In such a niche we see hundreds of
small idols set round in rows, four to eight inches high, in
silken mantles. Before them are taller statues of gods, and
Chinese vases of old valuable porcelain. Especial reverence
is shown to a cabinet with an open door, within which is
preserved a tablet, draped with <i>kadakhs</i>, and inscribed with
Chinese characters, in memory of the great Emperor
Kien-Lung who was admitted by the third Tashi Lama
into the confraternity of the yellow monks. Above, covering
the capitals of the pillars, is hung strange, shabbily-fine
drapery, of pieces of variously coloured cloth and paper
strips. For the rest, the hall abounds in the usual vessels,
brazen elephants with joss-sticks, large chalices and bowls,
small and large flags, and other things.</p>

<p>Another time I had been drawing in a sepulchral chapel
and taken the opportunity of making a sketch of some
female pilgrims who were praying there. When the work
was finished, we crossed a paved court fully 20 yards broad
by 90 long, which was situated just under the façade of
the Labrang. It was full of people waiting to see the
Tashi Lama, who was to pass by on his way to some
ceremony. He came in a red monk&rsquo;s frock and the
yellow mitre; above his head was held the yellow sunshade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
and he was accompanied by a train of monks. He
walked with his body slightly bent and an air of humility.
Many fell down before him full-length and worshipped him,
while others threw grains of rice over him. He did not see
me, but his smile was just as kind and mild as when we
last met. So he is evidently affable to all alike.</p>

<p>I made daily visits to the monastery and so gained
a thorough knowledge of the solitary life of the monks.
Gompa signifies &ldquo;the abode of solitude,&rdquo; or monastery;
the monks in the convent certainly live isolated from the
outer world, its vanities and temptations. Once, in the
Kanjur-lhakang, I purposed to draw the images with the
lamps burning before them on the innermost, darkest wall,
but just as I was about to begin monks filled the hall.
Their places on the long divans were made ready for them,
and before each seat a huge volume of the holy scriptures,
the Kanjur, lay on a long continuous desk. The large
yellow robes which are put on at service time, but may
not be worn in the open-air, were laid ready. The young,
brown-skinned, short-haired monks entered in red togas,
threw the yellow vestments over their shoulders, and sat
down cross-legged before the books. An older lama, a
Kanpo, mounted the pulpit on the shorter wall and intoned
the sacred text in a harsh, solemn, bass voice. The pupils
joined in a monotonous rhythm. Some read from the
pages in front of them, while others seemed to know the
words of the chant by heart&mdash;at any rate they looked all
about. Exemplary order is not observed. Some young fellows,
who certainly were much more at home in the world than
in the Church, talked during the chant, giggled, and buried
their faces in their robes to stifle their laughter. But no
one took any notice of them; they caused no disturbance.
Others never raised their eyes from the book. The hall
was as dark as a crypt, being lighted only by a narrow
skylight, and through two small doors (Illustration 154).</p>

<tr><td class="caption">146. <span class="sc">The Panchen Rinpoche, or Tashi Lama.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>After they had sung awhile there was an interval, and
lama boys passed along the gangways between the rows of
benches and poured tea, with wonderful adroitness and
without spilling a drop, into the wooden cups held out to
them. But almost before the pupils have begun to drink,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
the deep bass of the leader drones out in the gloom above,
and the proceedings recommence. Meanwhile pilgrims
pass along the gangways to the altar and place small heaps
of <i>tsamba</i> or meal in the bowls standing before the images,
from the bags and bundles they bring with them.</p>

<p>A tall lama stands erect at the entrance door. A
pilgrim says to him: &ldquo;I will pay 3 <i>tengas</i> for a blessing.&rdquo;
The lama sings out aloud the contribution and the purpose
for which it is given, and then a strophe is sung especially
on behalf of the pilgrim, after which all the monks clap
their hands. This is repeated whenever fresh pilgrims
come up. I myself paid 5 rupees for a blessing, and
received it together with a noisy clapping. For ten
minutes the lamas stand up, run along the passages outside
the lecture-hall, or take stock of me while I am sketching
the schoolroom and the pupils. Often a handful of rice
rains down upon the youths&mdash;some pilgrim is passing by
the window opening. At these readings and at the high
mass the monks who have been longest in the monastery
occupy the front seats, and the last-comers the back seats.
When the lecture is over the Kanpo-Lama counts the
receipts that have flowed in from the pockets of the
pilgrims, wraps the coins in paper, which is sealed up and
conveyed to the treasury, and enters the amount in a large
account book.</p>

<p>The images on the altar table of the Kanjur-lhakang
are small, and composed of gilded metal, and most of the
other idols in Tashi-lunpo are of the same kind. Some
are of carved wood, and a few, like the great statue of
Tsong Kapa, are composed of powdered spices cemented
together by a gum extracted from roots of plants. The statue
of Tsong Kapa is said to have been constructed seventy-two
years ago, and to have cost as much as one of gold. The
Tashi Lama has 1500 small gods cast for the New Year
festival, each costing 7 rupees; they are manufactured in
Tashi-lunpo, and are given away or sold. The manufacture
of these images is regarded as a peculiarly blessed
work, and the lamas engaged in it may count with certainty
on a long life. Especially is this the case with those who
make images of the Tsepagmed. The oftener they utter his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
name and produce his likeness from the rough metal, the
longer it will be before their poor souls have to set out on
their travels again. No idol, however, possesses any
miraculous power or the slightest shadow of divine
influence unless it is properly consecrated and blessed by
an incarnated lama.</p>

<p>I must by this time have tried the patience of my readers
with my personal recollections of the monastery of Tashi-lunpo.
I have unintentionally tarried too long with the
fraternity of the yellow-caps, and quite forgotten events
awaiting our attention elsewhere. I might have remembered
that temples and monks&rsquo; cells may not have the same interest
for others as they have for myself, but the remembrance of
this period is particularly dear to me, for I was treated
with greater friendliness and hospitality in Tashi-lunpo
than in any town of Central Asia. We came from the
wastes of Tibet to the greatest festival of the year, from
solitude into the religious metropolis swarming with
thousands of pilgrims, from poverty and want to abundance
of everything we wanted, and the howling of wolves
and storms gave place to hymns and fanfares from temple
roofs glittering with gold. The balls in Simla and the
desolate mountains of Tibet were strange contrasts, but
still greater the solitude of the mountain wilderness and
the holy town, which we entered in the garb of far-travelled
pilgrims, and where we were hospitably invited to look
about us and take part in all that was going on.</p>

<p>It is now time to say farewell to Tashi-lunpo, its mystic
gloom and its far-sounding trumpet blasts. I do so with
the feeling that I have given a very imperfect and fragmentary
description of it. It was not part of my plan to
thoroughly investigate the cloister town, but on the contrary
it was my desire to return as early as possible to the parts
of Tibet where I might expect to make great geographical
discoveries. Circumstances, however, which I shall hereafter
refer to in a few words, compelled us to postpone
our departure from day to day. As we were always looking
forward to making a start, our visits to the monastery
were curtailed. Moreover, I wished, if possible, to avoid
exciting suspicion. Tashi-lunpo had on two occasions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
more than 100 years ago indeed, been pillaged by Gurkhas
from Nepal. The English had quite recently made a
military expedition to Lhasa. Many monks disapproved
of my daily visits, and regarded it as unseemly that a
European, of whose exact intentions nothing was known,
should go about freely, sketch the gods, see all the
treasures of gold and precious stones, and make an inventory.
And it was known that the dominant race in
Tibet, the Chinese, were displeased at my coming hither,
and that I had really no right to sojourn in the forbidden
land. If, then, I wished to accomplish more, I must exercise
the greatest caution in all my proceedings.</p>

<p>A few words on funeral customs before we take leave
of Tashi-lunpo.</p>

<p>South-west of Tashi-lunpo lies a small village, Gompa-sarpa
or the New Monastery, where, according to tradition,
a temple formerly stood which was plundered by the
Dzungarians. Here is now the cemetery of Shigatse and of
the monastery, the Golgotha where the bodies of monks and
laymen are abandoned to corruption in the same fashion.</p>

<p>When the soul of a lama grows weary of the earthly
frame in which it has spent its human life, and the lama
himself, after living perhaps fifty years in his dark cloister
cell, perceives that the lamp of life is going out for
want of oil, some brethren gather round his sick-bed, recite
prayers, or intercede with the gods set up in his cell, whose
prototypes in Nirvana or in the kingdom of the dead
have something to do with death and the transmigration of
souls. As soon as life is extinct, special prayers for the
dead are recited to facilitate the severance of the soul from
the body, and console it during its first steps on the dark
road beyond the bounds of this life. The corpse of a lama
lies in his cell for three days, that of a layman as long as five
days, that there may be sufficient time for all the funeral
rites and services. Rich people retain the corpse longer
in the house, which is certainly more expensive, but
allows more time for prayers which will benefit the
deceased. Monks fix the date of interment and the
moment when the soul is actually freed from its earthly
fetters and soars up in search of a new habitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span></p>

<p>The dead lama in a new costume of the ordinary cut
and style is wrapped in a piece of cloth and is carried away
by one or two of his colleagues; a layman is borne on a bier
by the corpse-bearers. These are called <i>Lagbas</i>, and form
a despised caste of fifty persons, who live apart in fifteen
small miserable cabins in the village Gompa-sarpa. They
are allowed to marry only within the guild of corpse-bearers,
and their children may not engage in any other
occupation but that of their fathers, so that the calling is
hereditary. They are obliged to live in wretched huts
without doors or windows; the ventilators and doorways
are open to all the winds of heaven and all kinds of
weather. Even if they do their work well they are not
allowed to build more comfortable houses. It is their duty
also to remove dead dogs and carcasses from Tashi-lunpo,
but they may not enter within the wall round the convent.
If they have any uneasiness about their souls&rsquo; welfare, they
pay a lama to pray for them. When they die, their souls
pass into the bodies of animals or wicked men. But in
consequence of the afflictions they have endured they are
spared too hard a lot in the endless succession of transmigrations.</p>

<p>The Lagbas have only to hack in pieces lamas, their
own relations, and the bodies of the homeless poor. Well-to-do
laymen have this operation performed for their own
people without calling in professional aid.</p>

<p>When the monks come with a dead brother to the
place of dissection they strip him completely, divide his
clothes among them, and have no compunction in wearing
them the very next day. The Lagbas receive 2 to
5 <i>tengas</i> (11d. to 2s. 3d.) for each body and a part of the
old clothing of a lama; in the case of a layman the Lagba
receives all the raiment of the deceased, and the ear-rings
and other simpler ornaments of a woman. The monks
who have brought the body hurry off again with all speed,
partly because the smell is very bad and partly that
they may not witness the cutting up of the corpse, at which
only the Lagbas need be present; even when the body is
that of a layman, it is divided only in the presence of
Lagbas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span></p>

<p>A cord fastened to a post driven into the ground is
passed round the neck of the corpse, and the legs are
pulled as straight as possible&mdash;a feat requiring great
exertion in the case of a lama, who has died and become
rigid in a sitting posture. Then the body is skinned, so
that all the flesh is exposed; the Lagbas utter a call, and
vultures which roost around come sailing up in heavy
flight, pounce down on the prey, and tear and pluck at it
till the ribs are laid bare. There are no dogs here as in
Lhasa, and even if there were, they would get no share in
the feast, for the vultures do their work quickly and
thoroughly. We afterwards visited convents where sacred
dogs were fed with the flesh of priests. The Lagba sits by
while the vultures feed, and these are so tame that they
hop unconcernedly over the man&rsquo;s legs.</p>

<p>The head is usually cut off as soon as the body is
skinned. The skeleton is crushed to powder between
stones, and is kneaded with the brains into a paste, which
is thrown to the birds in small lumps. They will not
touch the bone-dust unless it is mixed with brains. The
guild of corpse-cutters pursue their task with the greatest
composure: they take out the brains with their hands,
knead it into powder, and pause in the midst of their
gruesome employment to drink tea and eat <i>tsamba</i>. I am
exceedingly doubtful if they ever wash themselves. An
old Lagba, whom I summoned to my tent to supplement
the information I had received from the monks, had on
that very morning cut up the body of an old lama.
Muhamed Isa held his cap before his face all through
the conversation, and had at last to go out, for he began to
feel ill. The man had an unpleasant rough aspect, wore a
small grey soft cap, and was dressed in rags of the coarsest
sacking. He had his own theories of post-mortem examination
and anatomy. He told me that when an effusion
of blood was found in the brain it was a sign that the man
had been insane, and that when the substance of the brain
was yellow the man had been an habitual snuff-taker.</p>

<p>In some cases, so a monk assured me, the corpse is not
skinned, but the head is cut off, the trunk is divided in two
along the spine with a sharp knife, and each half is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
cut into small pieces, and the vultures are not called till
this has been done. Small children and grown-up men
are cut up in the same manner. There is not the least
respect shown for the nakedness of dead women. The
whole aim of this method of disposing of the body is that
the deceased may have the merit of giving his body to the
birds, which would otherwise be famished. Thus even
after his death he performs a pious deed which will promote
the peace of his soul. The vultures here act the
same part as in the Towers of Silence among the Parsees
of Bombay and Persia.</p>

<p>As soon as the demands of religion are fulfilled, the
relatives take leave of the deceased. He is then gone
away, and his body is quite worthless; when the soul has
recommenced its wanderings, the body may be consigned
to the brutal treatment of the Lagbas without the least
hesitation. No one follows the corpse to the home of the
vultures when it is carried out of the house at night to be
cut up before the sun rises. There is no legal regulation,
and when the bodies are numerous, the sun has generally
risen before the work is finished. After that, one, or at
most two, of the corpses are left till evening and are taken
in hand after sunset. This is also because the vultures are
satiated with their morning&rsquo;s feed and must have a rest
before supper. It is seldom that more than two deaths are
reported in Gompo-sarpa in one day. About twelve years
ago when an epidemic of smallpox raged in Shigatse, forty to
fifty bodies were removed daily. Then, after the vultures
had gorged themselves, the rest of the bodies were wrapped
in thin shrouds and buried.</p>

<p>One would suppose that the dying man would shudder
at the thought that, at the very moment when the gates of
death were opened for him, his body, with which he was so
closely connected during his life, which he had cared for so
anxiously, endeavouring to shield it from danger and sickness,
nay, from the slightest pain, would be consigned to
such barbarous treatment. But probably he thinks more
of his soul in his last moments, and counts up the good
deeds he has performed and the millions of <i>manis</i> he has
recited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span></p>

<p>There is, then, not the slightest touch of sentiment in
the funeral customs of the Tibetans and their attitude
towards the dead. The children of Islam visit the graves
of their loved ones and weep out their sorrow under the
cypresses, but the Tibetans have no graves and no green-covered
mounds where they may devote an hour to the
remembrance of a lost happiness. They weep not, for
they mourn not, and they mourn not, because they have
loved not. How can they love a wife whom they possess
in common with others, so that there is no room for the
idea of faithfulness in marriage? The family ties are too
loose and uncertain, and the brother does not follow his
brother, the man his wife, and much less his child, to the
grave, for he does not even know if the child is really his
own. And, besides, the corpse in itself is a worthless
husk, and even a mother who has tenderly loved her child
feels not a shadow of reverence for its dead body, and has
no more horror of the knife of the corpse executioner than
we have of the doctor.</p>

<p>On one of the first days the Consul of Nepal paid me a
visit. He was a lieutenant, twenty-four years old, was
named Nara Bahadur Chetteri, and bore between his eyes
the yellow marks of his caste. He was dressed in a black
close-fitting uniform with bright metal buttons, and a round
forage cap on his head without a shade, but with a gold
tassel, and in front the sun of Nepal surrounded by a halo
of rays. He had been four months in Lhasa and two here.
He and his young wife had taken two months to travel
from Khatmandu; they had ridden the first week, but had
then sent their horses back, and had tramped through very
dangerous, pathless, mountainous regions for fifteen days;
the rest of the journey they had accomplished on hired
Tibetan horses. Here he had to protect the interests of the
150 Nepalese merchants and assist the pilgrims of his country
when they were in difficulties. The merchants have their
own <i>serai</i>, called Pere-pala, for which they pay an annual
rent of 500 <i>tengas</i>; they buy wool from the nomads in the
north, and pay for it with corn and flour, which therefore
is scarce and dear in Shigatse, especially during the festival
time when so many pilgrims flock in. The Consul received
200 <i>tengas</i> a month, or rather less than £60 a year, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>
considered that the Maharaja paid him very badly. Bhotan
has no consul in Shigatse, though many pilgrims come
from that country.</p>

<p>On February 14 I received a very unexpected visit,
a lama and an official from Lhasa. When the Devashung,
the Government, had received the letter of Hlaje Tsering
announcing my arrival at the Ngangtse-tso, the Chinese
Ambassador and the Government, after consulting together,
had despatched these two gentlemen in forced marches to
the lake, where, however, they arrived several days after
my departure. Singularly enough they had been given
quite erroneous information about the route we had taken,
perhaps because our wanderings over the ice across the
lake in all directions had confused the nomads. Therefore
they had sought for us for twenty-two days on the shores
of the Ngangtse-tso and the Dangra-yum-tso, until they
had at length discovered that we had gone off southwards
a long time before. Then they had followed our track and
had made further inquiries among the nomads, all of whom
said that they had been kindly treated, and well paid for all
they sold us. The gentlemen rode on, and heard in Yeshung
that we had passed through a couple of days before;
our camp-fires were scarcely cold. They changed horses,
and spurred them on at a faster pace, for they had been
ordered to force us at any cost to return northwards by the
same way we had come. But I had got the better of them,
for they did not reach Shigatse till thirty-six hours after us,
and another party sent from Lhasa to intercept us by a more
direct road had quite lost our trail in the labyrinth of
valleys and mountains into which we had plunged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have carried out our mission as well as we have
been able,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and it only remains for us to ask
for your name and all particulars of your journey and
companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already communicated everything to Ma Daloi
and Duan Suen, who have seen my passport, but if you
want a second edition, you are welcome to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is our duty to send a report to the Devashung.
In virtue of the treaty of Lhasa only the market-towns of
Yatung, Gyangtse, and Gartok are free to the Sahibs under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span>
certain conditions, but no other routes. You have come
by forbidden roads and must turn back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not close the way to me? It is your
own fault. You can inform the Devashung that I shall
never be content till I have seen the whole of Tibet.
Besides, the Devashung will not find it worth their while
to place obstacles in my way, for I am on good terms with
your gods, and you have seen yourself how friendly the
Tashi Lama has been to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know it, and it seems as though you bore the
sign of the favour of the gods on your forehead like caste-markings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Hlaje Tsering getting on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is suspected of receiving a bribe from you; he
has been dismissed, and has lost his rank and all his property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very mean of the Devashung to persecute him.
But the Government is composed of the most despicable
rogues in all Tibet. You ought to be glad that you are at
length properly under Chinese protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first they exchanged meaning looks, but gradually
they came round to my opinion and admitted that their
Government was a disagreeable association. The reason
they had not shown themselves immediately after their
arrival was that they wished first to spy out our occupations
and our associates; for, if they found out that we had
friends, these would of course be denounced. Otherwise
they were decent men, and readily partook of tea and
cigarettes. Unfortunately Tsaktserkan was just then with
me, and he must have thought the affair serious, for he
made himself scarce as soon as they entered my tent, but
afterwards asked me to tell him what they had said.</p>

<p>It impressed them most of all that, in spite of all the
ambushes and traps in the form of scouting patrols, who
were on the look-out for us, we had after all succeeded in
advancing to Shigatse. Now they would wait for orders
from Lhasa. No heed was paid to the Dalai Lama, who
was as good as dead and buried.</p>

<p>They came frequently during the following days to
greet us, and then expressed their opinions of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
superiors more and more frankly. Their remaining on
the scene proved, however, that both the Chinese and
the Government had their eyes on me. I wondered how
the affair would terminate.</p>

<p>When I returned from the equestrian performance on
the 15th, I found a large packet of letters from Major
O&rsquo;Connor, and greedily seized letters from home and from
friends in India, Lady Minto, Colonel Dunlop Smith,
Younghusband, and O&rsquo;Connor himself, who welcomed me
most heartily, and expressed a hope that we should soon
meet. He had also kindly given me a great surprise with
two boxes containing preserved meats, cakes, biscuits,
whisky, and four bottles of champagne. Fancy my drinking
champagne alone in my tent in Tibet! I drank a glass
at dinner every day to the health of Major O&rsquo;Connor as
long as the supply lasted.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Leh I mentioned the Hajji Nazer
Shah and his son Gulam Razul. The old Hajji had
another son in Shigatse, named Gulam Kadir, who had
been ten years in Tibet and now managed the branch in
Shigatse. He sold chiefly gold-embroidered stuffs from
China and Benares, which the lamas bought for state robes,
and he told me that he made a yearly profit of 6000 rupees.
A bale of such material as he showed me was worth
10,000 rupees. Gulam Kadir rendered me many services
at this time, and supplied us with anything we wanted.</p>

<p>There is a fine view from the roof of his house of the
Dzong, or fort, the stately front of which seems to grow
out of the rock. The windows, balconies, roof decorations
and streamers have a harmonious and picturesque effect.
In the middle of the structure is a red building; all the
rest is white, or rather an undecided greyish-yellow colour,
which the plaster has assumed in the course of time.</p>

<p>At the southern foot of the Dzong hill lies the open
market-place, where trade was carried on two hours a day.
There are no tables and stands, but the dealer sits on the
dusty ground and spreads out his wares on cloths or keeps
them beside him in baskets. In one row sit the dealers in
implements and utensils, in others boards and planks are
sold, ironware, woven goods, coral, glass beads, shells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
sewing thread, needles, dyes, cheap oleographs, spices and
sugar from India, porcelain, pipes, figs and tea from China,
mandarins from Sikkim, dried fruits and turquoise from
Ladak, yak hides and tails from the Chang-tang, pots,
metal dishes, covers and saucers manufactured in the
town, religious books and other articles for the use of
pilgrims, etc. Straw and chaff, rice, grain, <i>tsamba</i> and
salt are sold by many traders. Walnuts, raisins, sweets,
and radishes are other wares in which there is a large
trade. Horses, cows, asses, pigs, and sheep are also on
sale; for the last, 7 rupees a head are asked. In Chang-tang
we had paid at most 4 rupees, and a sheep can be got
for 2 rupees. Every kind of ware has its particular place,
but the traders, so far as I could see, were all Tibetans; for
the merchants of Ladak, China, and Nepal have shops in
their own houses.</p>

<p>Most of the traders are women, and they sell even hay,
firewood, and meat. They wear huge coils of hair with
inferior turquoise, glass beads, and all kinds of pendants,
which contrast strongly with their faces smeared with black
salve. If they would dispense with this finery and give
themselves a good washing instead, some of them would
perhaps look quite human. What was the original colour
of their clothes is hard to guess, for they are now caked
with dust, soot, and dirt. But these hucksters are always
polite and obliging; they sit in rows parallel to the north
wall of the Chinese town, which is little more than a ruin.
Now and then a mule caravan passes along the pathway
between the rows, bringing new goods to market. Frequently
gentlemen partly dressed in Chinese fashion ride
past from the Dzong; and among the swarms of customers
are seen all kinds of people&mdash;clergy and pilgrims, children
of the country and strangers, white turbans from Ladak
and Kashmir, and black skull-caps from China. In the
market all the gossip of Shigatse is hatched; all sorts of
reports more or less probable reach us from there. As
soon as any one comes from Lhasa he is driven almost
frantic with questions, for all take a deep interest in the new
Chinese régime. It was current in the bazaar that lamas
in Lhasa were organizing a bloody insurrection against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
Chinese, because the latter had demanded that half the
lamas should serve in the army. It was further reported
that I and my companions would soon be compelled to
leave the country, and that before very long the English
commercial agency in Gyangtse would be closed. Every
one who has heard anything fresh carries it at once to the
market, where the visitors who come to hear news are as
numerous as those who make purchases. In a word the
market is Shigatse&rsquo;s only newspaper.</p>

<p>Gulam Kadir told me that the two gentlemen from
Lhasa employed spies, who reported daily all that they
could find out about us. These men used to come as
hawkers into our tents and sit there by the hour. Ma also
encompassed us with spies. With the help of Gulam Kadir
I set two Ladakis as spies to spy upon the spies of the
Lhasa spies. We could now be on our guard, for we knew
what was going on around us.</p>

<p>My own Ladakis enjoyed in Shigatse a very necessary
period of rest. I gave them money for new clothes, which
they made up themselves; in a few days they appeared in
all the glory of a new outfit from head to foot. Nor could
I refuse them a jug of <i>chang</i> daily; they very seldom drank
too much, after one of them one day under the influence
of beer painted his face black, and in this guise made
ridiculous pirouettes about the court. Muhamed Isa
happened to come home from the market just at the
moment, and, catching hold of the dancer, gave him such
a thorough drubbing that he never thought of painting
himself again. Both Chinamen and Tibetans said that the
conduct of my men was exemplary and gave no cause for
quarrels. But to hear Tsering&rsquo;s singing in the evening!
It was like the creaking of a badly oiled wicket-gate to
a shed in my own country, and therefore I listened with
pleasure to his rude song. When he had sung for three
hours on end, it became a little too much, but I put up
with it&mdash;it is so pleasant to have cheerful, contented men
about one.</p>

<p>Under February 19 the following entry stands in my
diary: &ldquo;In spite of the windy, dusty weather I have all
day long been sketching various types, chiefly women, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
sat for me as models in front of my tent.&rdquo; The first were
from Nam-tso (Tengri-nor) (Illustration 155), wore head-dresses
decorated with shells, china beads, and silver
spangles, and in their sheepskins trimmed with red and
blue ribands looked like girls from Dalecarlia. They had
large bones, were strongly built, looked fresh and healthy,
and their broad faces were remarkably clean. The women
of Shigatse, on the other hand, had smeared their faces
with a brown salve mixed with soot which looked like tar.
This mask makes them hideous, and it is impossible to tell
whether they are pretty or not; the black colour interferes
with the lights and shadows, and confuses the portrait
painter. One had painted only her nose and rubbed it
bright as metal. This singular custom is said to date
from a time when the morality of the Lhasa monks was
at a low level, and a Dalai Lama issued orders that no
female should show herself out of doors unless painted
black, so that the charms of the women might be less
seductive to the men. Since then the black paint has
remained in fashion, but seems now to be going out.</p>

<p>The clothes are always black with age, dirt, and soot.
The women pay most attention to their head decoration,
and the higher they are in the social scale the more profusely
they deck their coiffures with bows, pendants, and
jewelry. The hair is frequently so closely entwined with
all this finery that it can scarcely be let down every night,
but only when it becomes so entangled that it must be put
straight. Those who are rich wear large heavy ear-rings
of solid gold and a few turquoises, but others simpler and
smaller rings. On the neck are worn chains of various
coloured beads and <i>gaos</i>, small silver cases studded with
coral and turquoise and containing amulets. Poor women
have to be contented with copper <i>gaos</i> of the clumsy kind
so common among the Tsaidam Mongols.</p>

<p>A woman of forty belonging to Shigatse was named
Tashi-Buti; she looked sixty, for women age very soon
here. Above her ordinary clothing she wore a coarse
shawl over the shoulders, fastened in front with brass
clasps, plates, and rings.</p>

<p>A nomad woman from Kamba had the right arm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
shoulder bare, and was as powerfully and muscularly built
as a man, but was so horribly dirty that it was impossible
to perceive her complexion. She had no head-dress; but
the dark hair was plaited into innumerable thin rat&rsquo;s tails
hanging over the shoulders, and tied together on the forehead
into a mane of cords. She would have been good-looking
if her features had not been so masculine; she sat
still and solemn as a statue of Buddha. A fifteen-year-old
girl had a parting in the middle, and her hair frizzed in two
pads down to the ears, which were combed, oiled, and shiny
like those of a Japanese, and she wore a diadem studded
with coral. She was dainty and clean and had rosy
cheeks (Illustrations 157, 158, 159).</p>

<p>Burtso was a little Shigatse lady of seventeen summers,
and bore the dirt of those seventeen summers on her face.
Like most of the others her features had the sharply marked
characteristics of the Mongolian race&mdash;oblique narrow eyes
contracting to a point at the sides, and the lower part of
the eyelid telescoped into the upper so that a slightly
curved line is formed and the short lashes are almost
covered; the iris is dark chestnut brown, and appears
black within the frame of the eyelids; the eyebrows are
usually only slightly marked, are thin and irregular, and
never form the finely curved Persian and Caucasian arch
like a crescent. The cheek-bones are rather prominent,
but not so high as with the Mongolians; the lips are
rather large and thick, but the nose is not so flat as among
the Mongols. Faces with handsome features are seen
among the male Tibetans. But the differences between
individual Tibetans are often as great as between Tibetans
on the one hand and Mongols, Chinamen, and Gurkhas on
the other. The nomads of the Chang-tang are apparently
a tribe of themselves, and seldom, if ever, intermarry with
the others. Otherwise the Tibetan people is undoubtedly
much mixed with neighbouring elements. Chinamen
living in Lhasa and Shigatse marry Tibetan women. In
the Himalayas, south of the Tibetan frontier, live the
Bothias, a mixed people, sprung partly from Indian,
partly from Tibetan elements. The people of Ladak have
mingled to a large extent with their Aryan and Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
neighbours, because they have been in closer and more
active contact with them. The Tibetan people present
remarkable and peculiar problems in anthropological,
ethnographical, and linguistic science, which must be
solved by future investigation.</p>

<p>I drew on and on, and one type after another found its
way into my sketch-book. The expression of my models
is listless and devoid of animation; they seem absent-minded
and passionless. They take little interest in the
proceedings; all they care about is to pocket the rupees
after the sitting. They sit motionless, without laughing
or complaining. They are rather too solemn, and not
a smile plays round the corners of their mouths when
their eyes meet mine. I passed the greater part of the
day in this silent, apathetic female society.</p>

<p>Now and then comes a party of inquisitive people to
watch me, Tibetans, Chinamen, or pilgrims who want to
have something to tell when they get home again to their
black tents. They stand round me, wondering whether it
is dangerous to be drawn by a European and what is the
object of it. Of course there are many spies among them.
There is an endless variety of types and costumes, and as
I ride through the streets and see the inhabitants at their
various occupations, I feel oppressed by the thought that I
have not time to draw them all. Here stands a man
splitting wood, there come two young fellows driving
before them asses laden with twigs and branches. There
go a couple of women with large water-jugs on their backs,
while small girls collect cattle dung from the street. Here
a group of officials approaches in yellow garments on fine
horses, while some lamas stroll slowly towards the
monastery. All is so picturesque, so charming for the
pencil; one is constantly delighted with attractive subjects,
genre pictures of unusual character, strikingly grouped
parties of salesmen and customers; one could spend
months here, drawing again and again. I am grieved at
the prospect of an early departure.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a company of dancers, male and
female, frequently appears in the court and gives no
despicable performances, reminding me strongly of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
dances in Leh. They are always introduced by our little
old mother Mamu, who has the management of the garden,
and hops about smiling and friendly as a sparrow. She
speaks Urdu, so Robert employs her as interpreter. Then
come caravans, bringing hay, firewood, chaff, and barley
for our remaining animals, or provisions for ourselves, and
people are constantly coming to sell all kinds of goods&mdash;chickens,
eggs, butter, or fish from the Tsangpo; milkmen
run with their clattering metal cans, and stringed instruments
and flutes make music in our groves. A beggar
comes up like a troubadour to my tent with a lute, and
sings a melodious air. When I look at him he stops
singing and puts out his tongue. Barefooted boys, who
could be no blacker if they were drawn twice up a chimney,
run about laughing loudly, and peep out from among the
trees. Three of them perform on a tight rope, dance like
professional rope-dancers, and beat drums, while they turn
summersaults all mixed up together (Illustration 164).</p>

<p>Pious visitors also frequent my courtyard: two nuns,
for instance, with a large <i>tanka</i> representing a series of
complicated episodes from the holy scriptures. While one
chants the explanation, the other points with a stick to the
corresponding picture (Illustration 165). She sings so
sweetly and with so much feeling that it is a pleasure to listen
to her. Or a mendicant lama comes with his praying mill
in his hand and two hand-grooves hung by a strap round
his neck. In these he pushes his hands as in a curry-comb,
when he prostrates himself on the ground in making a
circuit of the temple. They are much worn, and this
moves the hearts of the people to generosity, so that his
alms bowl is filled daily.</p>

<p>These pious men are the parasites of Tibet, living at
the expense of the working population. And yet they are
endured and treated by every one with the greatest consideration
and respect. To give them a mite brings a
blessing on the giver. The people are kept by the lamas in
spiritual slavery, and the lamas themselves are docile slaves
to those tomes of narrow-minded dogmas which have been
stereotyped for centuries, which may not be interfered with
or criticised, for they are canonical, proclaim the absolute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
truth, and stand in the way of all free and independent
thought. The clergy form a very considerable percentage
of the scanty population of this poor country. Without
the Peter&rsquo;s pence Tibet could not make both ends meet.
Tashi-lunpo is, then, a huge savings-box, in which the rich
man places his pile of gold, the poor man his mite. And
with what object? To propitiate the monks, for they are
the mediators between the gods and the people. Scarcely
any other land is so completely under the thumb of the
priests as Tibet. And while the people toil, the monks
gather round their tea-pots and bowls of <i>tsamba</i> at the
summons of the conch.</p>

<p>On three evenings in succession large numbers of wild-geese
have flown low over our garden from north-west to
south-east. The ravens are as bold as usual; of other
birds only sparrows roost in our trees. Our camp within
the wall is quiet, but we have posted a night-watch outside,
for in a town like Shigatse, full of all sorts of vagabonds,
there are many scoundrels. Two monks, who were with
me one evening to answer my inquiries, durst not return
to Tashi-lunpo in the dark, unless I sent some of my men
armed with guns to take them home. Recently a lama
was attacked at night between the town and the monastery
and stripped to the skin.</p>

<p>On February 20, after only 17.6 degrees of frost, it
snowed all day long, the wind howled dismally through the
poplars, and the snow fell on my tent. Nothing was to be
seen of the golden temple roofs, and the ground and the
mountains were white; there was no one in the bazaar,
and no inquisitive visitors pestered us. It was just as in
the Chang-tang.</p>

<p>On March 4 Gulam Kadir paid me a farewell visit, for
he was going next day to Lhasa, which, according to his
reckoning, was nine days&rsquo; journey distant. As he would
pass through Gyangtse, he took a large letter-bag to Major
O&rsquo;Connor. On the day before, he had sent off a caravan
of 201 yaks laden with brick tea to Ladak. A yak carries
24 bricks, and a brick costs in Shigatse 6 rupees, but in
Ladak 9 to 11. It is only the refuse of the tea, which is
despised in China, but is good enough for Tibetans and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span>
Ladakis. Gulam Kadir hires the yaks at a cost of 5
rupees a head to Gartok&mdash;uncommonly cheap, but they
follow the mountain paths and their keep costs nothing.
They are five months on the way, for the caravan makes
short marches and stays at places where grass grows
luxuriantly. From Gartok, where the Hajji Nazer Shah
has a large warehouse, managed by Gulam Razul, the tea
is transported on other yaks. By a single caravan of
this kind the commercial house of the Hajji makes a very
large profit. Musk, coral, Chinese textiles, and other
valuable goods are forwarded on mules along the great
highway which runs along the Tsangpo and the upper
Indus.</p>

<p>I had on several occasions met Kung Gushuk, the
Duke, in the monastery, and had thanked him for his
kindness in sending my letters to the lakes, but it was not
till March 7 that I paid him a visit in his house. The
walls in the entrance hall are painted with tigers and
leopards. In the court, round which the stables and
servants&rsquo; quarters are situated, a large black watch-dog,
with red eyes and a red swollen ring round his neck, is
chained up, and is so savage that he has to be held while
we pass. After mounting two ladder-like staircases we
come to the reception-room, which is very elegant, and has
square red pillars with carved capitals in green and blue.
Along the walls stands a row of shrines of gilded wood
with burning butter-lamps in front of them, and over them
hang photographs of the Tashi Lama which were taken in
Calcutta. The rest of the walls are draped with holy
banners (Illustration 167).</p>

<p>The trellised window pasted over with paper, which
occupies nearly the whole length of the wall towards the
courtyard, and is draped with white curtains on the outside,
is placed rather high above the floor. Immediately below
the window runs a long divan mattress, on which a square
cushion covered with panther skin marks the seat of
honour. Before this cushion stand two small stool-like
lacquered tables on golden feet. Seated here one has on
the left hand, against the shorter wall, a cubical throne
with steps leading up to it, and here the Tashi Lama takes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
his seat when he visits his younger brother, now twenty-one
years of age.</p>

<p>Kung Gushuk is, then, quite young. He is very shy,
and is evidently relieved when his guest talks and he is
not obliged to strain his own small, poorly furnished brain.
His recollections of India, whither he had accompanied
his illustrious brother, were very hazy: he did know that
Calcutta is a large town, and that the weather was excessively
hot there, but for the rest the journey seemed to be
to him only an unintelligible dream. He did not venture
to give an opinion on the journey before me, but said
openly that the lamas did not like to see me so often in
Tashi-lunpo. His wife had sent to ask me if I would take
her portrait, and I now begged to be told what time would
suit her. &ldquo;Any time.&rdquo; When I went away, Her Highness
was standing with her black court ladies at the other end
of the open gallery surrounding a court (Illust. 168). I
saluted her politely, and certainly fascinated the lady as
I passed; there was no danger, as she was quite <i>passée</i>,
for she had belonged in common to Kung Gushuk and
an elder brother, who died in Sikkim on the return from
India. It is said that she rules the house and keeps the
finances in order, and with good reason, for Kung Gushuk
leads a fast life, is over head and ears in debt, and
plays hazard. This is bad form in a brother of the Tashi
Lama.</p>

<p>On March 22 the portrait-drawing came off; it was
executed in the large saloon and in pencil. The Duchess
is big and bloated, and asserted that she was thirty-three
years old&mdash;I should put her down at forty-five. Her
complexion is fair and muddy, the white of her eyes is
dull. She had put on for this occasion all the finery she
could find room for; a pearl pendant which hung on the
left side of her façade had cost 1200 rupees. In her hair
were thick strings of pearls, bunches of coral and turquoises.
She was friendly and amiable, and said that she did not
mind how long she sat, if only the result were good. Her
small carpet-knight of a husband sat by and looked on, and
round us stood the other inmates of the house, including
a small brother of Kung Gushuk and the Tashi Lama.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
They drank butter tea, but did not offer me any, which
made the visit all the pleasanter (Illustration 170).</p>

<p>Then we were shown the other apartments, which even
on sunny days are dark as dungeons, for the windows are
small, the paper thick, and the white curtains outside help
to increase the gloom. A small oratory with red pillars
was so dark that the images of the gods could scarcely be
distinguished. In the study of the Duke a low divan stood
at the window, with paper, inkstand, pens, and a religious
book on a table in front of it. The bedroom was adorned
with <i>tankas</i>, statues, and cups. Here and there butter-lamps
struggled with the darkness, while braziers of brass
on stands of dark carved wood were used to counteract the
chilliness of the air. The whole house is like a temple,
which is quite as it should be when the owner is brother of
the Grand Lama.</p>

<p>Two passages connecting parts of the upper storey are
not covered in, so are exposed to all the winds of heaven.
A third staircase leads to the top of the roof, which is
surrounded by a parapet a yard high, and is white-washed.
A thicket of roof decorations and bundles of rods with
streamers frightens away evil spirits. There was a violent
wind, and dust and bits from the streets of Shigatse flew
up in the air, so that our eyes received their share. With
the portrait-drawing the visit lasted four good hours, and at
the end I had become as intimate with the family as if I had
known them from childhood.</p>

<p class="center chap2">POLITICAL COMPLICATIONS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> the first chapters of this book I described very briefly
the difficulties placed in my way by the English, and told
how the Liberal Government in London had not only
refused the favours I had asked for, but had even tried to
suppress my expedition altogether. In consequence I had
been compelled to make a wide detour all through the
Chang-tang, where more than once our lives hung by a
thread, and we had suffered great losses. Then we met
with a weak resistance on the part of the Tibetans, but,
nevertheless, came to Shigatse; it was pure good luck
that the patrols sent out to intercept us had not fallen in
with us. On February 14 the representatives of the
Tibetan Government had intimated to me that I had no
right to make a prolonged sojourn in Tibet, and that I
must leave the country. As though I had not enough to
do with the English, Indian, and Tibetan Governments,
the Chinese Government also appeared on the scene on
February 18. I was now opposed to a fourfold combination
of Governments, and wished all politics and diplomatists
at Jericho.</p>

<p>On this day the young Chinaman Duan Suen appeared
on behalf of Gaw Daloi, the Chinese political agent in
Gyangtse. He brought me a letter from him with the following
curt contents:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Agreement between Great Britain and China, signed in Pekin
in the year 1906, § 2: The Government of Great Britain binds
itself not to annex any Tibetan territory, and not to interfere in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
administration of Tibet. Convention concluded on September 7,
1904, § 9b: No representative or agent of any foreign Power shall
receive permission to visit Tibet.</p>
</div>

<p>Duan Suen also conveyed to me by word of mouth
Gaw Daloi&rsquo;s message that I must on no account travel to
Gyangtse, as I had forced my way to Shigatse without
a passport or permit, and that only one route was open to
me, that through the Chang-tang, by which I had come.
I answered as curtly that Gaw Daloi should apply to
Major O&rsquo;Connor, the British representative in Gyangtse,
if he wished to learn anything about me, instead of sending
me impertinent letters.</p>

<p>It had been my plan and desire to visit O&rsquo;Connor. I
knew him very well by repute; he had loaded me with kindnesses,
and I knew that he was one of the very few who had
a thorough knowledge of Tibet.</p>

<p>We had been in constant correspondence with one
another since my arrival. I had explained to him my
ideas about the western continuation of the great mountain
system, and O&rsquo;Connor had replied that he had always
longed to explore the extensive unknown parts in the
interior of Tibet, and had long suspected the existence of
a mighty mountain system to the north of the Tsangpo.
I had still an imperfect knowledge of this system, and
therefore I proposed to O&rsquo;Connor that we should in future
call the mountains Nien-chen-tang-la after the lofty peak
on the south shore of the Tengri-nor. It would have been
of the greatest advantage to me to meet a man like Major
O&rsquo;Connor just at this time (Illustration 171).</p>

<p>Meanwhile I soon began to regard the affair in a different
light, for I perceived that in Gyangtse I should find
myself in a worse position than in Shigatse. As long as I
remained in Shigatse, the Chinese did not know what to
do with me, but in Gyangtse the provisions of the treaty
would at once become applicable to my case, and I might
be obliged to retire southwards to India. Gaw Daloi&rsquo;s
prohibition with regard to Gyangtse irritated me a little,
but I suspected him of using it as a stratagem, and all the
more because the authorities of Shigatse offered at the same
time to let me baggage animals on hire for my journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
thither. Tsaktserkan, as well as Ma, knew that I had
received a letter from Gaw, and Ma had long negotiations
with the gentlemen from Lhasa. Evidently a political
intrigue was going on, and all depended on my playing my
cards well.</p>

<p>As early as February 20 I had noticed that the lamas
were afraid of the Chinese because of my frequent visits to
the monastery, and were becoming more reserved daily.
I, however, quietly continued to place myself under their
noses, and even to draw the Sakya-tubpa (Buddha).
The Chinese pretended to fear that the English would
reproach them with a breach of the treaty if they suffered
me to sojourn on forbidden ground. My English friends,
on the contrary, rejoiced at my success and hoped that I
should continue to hold out. Meantime a change might
come any day, and therefore I lived in the greatest
agitation.</p>

<p>In my answer to Gaw Daloi I begged him to have no
anxiety lest I, a Swede, should have any intention of
annexing Tibetan territory, and as to § 9, he had not
quoted it fully, for it ran as follows: &ldquo;The Government
of Tibet undertakes not to allow a representative or agent
of any foreign Power to visit Tibet without the previous
consent of the Government of Great Britain.&rdquo; This
paragraph did not apply to my case, for I was already
in Tibet, and it did not concern me what agreements the
two Governments had made together. My case must be
treated from quite a different standpoint.</p>

<p>Ma had at first consented to send my letters to Gyangtse,
but now he refused, with the excuse that he might seem
too ready to oblige me. Therefore Muhamed Isa had to
ride off on February 24 for Gyangtse, to carry my letter
and passport to Gaw Daloi, and also to take 3000 rupees in
sovereigns, which Major O&rsquo;Connor had promised to exchange
for silver coins.</p>

<p>I also sent a long telegram to the English Prime
Minister, asking for the &ldquo;consent of the Government of
Great Britain,&rdquo; as the Government of Tibet had hitherto
placed no practical obstacles in my way. To this telegram
I received no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span></p>

<p>On February 27 Gaw&rsquo;s answer arrived&mdash;not by Muhamed
Isa, but by a special messenger; this was diplomatic
but imprudent. Gaw wrote that he could not believe I
would break a treaty between two great nations for the
sake of scientific exploration, that my Chinese passport was
not valid here, and that if I were allowed to travel about
in Tibet, Russians and Englishmen might claim the same
privileges. He concluded with the words: &ldquo;I have received
orders from my Government to arrest you at once, should
you come to Gyangtse, and send you with a guard of soldiers
across the Indian frontier.&rdquo; I afterwards learned that he
had not a single soldier, and that if he had had the whole
Chinese army at his command, he could not have used it
against me, if I were staying in Gyangtse as a guest in the
British Agency. I replied, however, that I was quite
willing to set out, in a north-westerly direction, if Gaw
could provide me with a sufficiently large caravan.</p>

<p>On March 1 Ma visited me. He was quite beside
himself. The Amban Lien in Lhasa had sharply reprimanded
him because, with 1000 native and 150 Chinese
soldiers under his command, he had not been intelligent
and watchful enough to prevent my coming to Shigatse.
He had now to inform me that I must leave the town at
once, and asked me to tell him on what day I proposed to
start. &ldquo;Not for a good while yet,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The
caravan which is to take me back across the Chang-tang
must be ready first.&rdquo; The monks also had been advised
from Lhasa to have as little to do with me as possible.</p>

<p>My sojourn in Shigatse had, then, given rise to an
exchange of notes and telegrams between Lhasa, Gyangtse,
Shigatse, Pekin, Calcutta, and London, and quite against
my will I had become a small apple of discord among
politicians. My position was so uncertain that I left no
stone unturned. The Swedish Minister, Herr G. O.
Wallenberg, did all he could in Pekin to obtain for me the
permission of the Chinese Government and a passport; he
spoke with all the high mandarins, but they with the greatest
affability appealed to the treaties in force. The Japanese
Embassy in Pekin also made representations, at the request
of Count Otani (Kioto), but received the astonishing answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
that, if I were in Tibet at all, which was very doubtful, I
must be at once expelled from the country. So I met with
refusals on all sides. But I was strong in one respect: I
stood alone, while my opponents were hampered by having
to pay respect to one another&rsquo;s susceptibilities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was initiated little by little into the
mysteries of Tibetan politics. Tsaktserkan, sent by the
Tashi Lama, used to visit me at dusk. He asked me how
it came about that, after the English had been victorious
against Tibet, China reaped all the advantages of the
victory, and China&rsquo;s power increased in the country while
England&rsquo;s prestige declined. The Tashi Lama was much
disturbed by the continued absence of the Dalai Lama.
Immediately after his return from India he had sent
presents to the Dalai Lama, and written several letters
to him, but had never received a reply. The Dalai Lama
had been his tutor, and he was grieved that he could not
help him in his difficult situation. The authorities at
Lhasa were incensed against Tashi-lunpo, and asserted
that the Tashi Lama had been bribed by the English not
to take part in the war. The Tashi Lama sent to ask me
if I thought that the Emperor of China was angry with him
because of his journey to India, to which I answered that
in my opinion the Emperor would be pleased if the Tashi
Lama maintained peace with his powerful neighbour to
the south, and if there was a good understanding between
Tibet and India.</p>

<p>Then on March 5 I received a remarkable letter from
Gaw Daloi. He advised me &ldquo;in strict confidence&rdquo; to
write to Chang Yin Tang (Tang Darin, or the Imperial
Chinese Chief Commissioner in Tibet), and to the Amban
Lien Yü in Lhasa, requesting Their Excellencies to grant
me permission as a particular favour to travel through
Gyangtse to Sikkim; he had no doubt that they would
agree to the proposal. First, he had written to me that
his Government had ordered him to arrest me if I came to
Gyangtse, and now he advised me to go there. But by
acting contrary to the orders of his Government, he gave
me a dangerous hold over him: I had him now in my
power, and regarded him as out of the running. I then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
learned in a roundabout way that his letter had been written
in accordance with orders from Lhasa, where it was feared
that I might not be easily got rid of if I were permitted to
penetrate further into Tibet on my return journey. Ma
informed me that he had orders to keep couriers in readiness
for me, and that a letter would reach Lhasa in five
days.</p>

<p>I now wrote to the Tang Darin, telling him that I
would on no account act against the wishes of the
Chinese Government by travelling through Gyangtse, but
intended to return towards the north-west, if His Excellence
would command that yaks should be placed at my disposal.
As a Swede, I belonged to a country which had from
ancient times been on friendly terms with China, and had
no political interests in Tibet.</p>

<p>At the same time I wrote also to Lien Darin, and
represented that neither the Chinese nor the Tibetan
Government had any reason to complain of my journey
to Shigatse; if my coming were displeasing to them, they
should have prevented me in good time. On the contrary,
they ought to be grateful to me for calling attention to the
possibility of traversing their country, and I advised them
to be more watchful in future if they wished to exclude
Europeans. I should not think of travelling to India, for
my people were mountaineers and would drop down in the
heat like flies; they were, moreover, British subjects, and
I was answerable for their safe return to Leh. It was
impossible to travel through the Chang-tang, but I would
willingly follow a route on the north side of the Tsangpo,
where there were nomads. If they wished to get rid of
me, they should not render my return more difficult, but rather
facilitate it in every way.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Lhasa gentlemen and the deputies
from the Shigatse Dzong urged me that same day to start
without delay, I was able to reply that it could not possibly
be done till ten days later, for it would take so long to receive
an answer from Lhasa.</p>

<p>Our position was still like an imprisonment, though
everything was done to get rid of us. On March 4 I
was in Tashi-lunpo for the last time. Now I was excluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
from the monastery, for I had been expressly requested to
cease my visits for fear of the suspicion of the Chinese. I
promised, but on condition that I should first be permitted
to see the Ngakang, where the vestments and masks are
stored. When this was declared impossible, we at last
came to an agreement that some vestments, masks, and
instruments should be brought to my garden, where I
should have an opportunity of sketching them. The
objects were brought at night, and while I drew them
in the daytime, a watch was kept round the house so that
the lamas need not fear being caught. So we came to
March 10, when Tashi arrived with my last 13 yaks, which
were so worn out that they were handed over to a dealer at
a nominal price.</p>

<p>Under March 12 the following entry appears in my
diary: &ldquo;In this holy land the spring is heralded in by
kettle-drums and trumpets shriller than any that are
sounded at dawn from the temple roofs, and summon the
lamas to their first tea. Storms, dark masses of cloud, and
dust whirling along the ground, and hiding all the environs
except the Dzong fort, which peeps through dust-mist like
a dismal phantom ship. The temperature rises, and in the
day is several degrees above freezing-point, but there is no
other sign of spring. It will come sometime or other, if it
is now turning in bed and trying to rub the winter sleep
out of its frozen eyes. To-day raged one of the most
violent storms we have experienced. The bells of the
monastery rang like storm bells, but their sound did not
reach us amid the howling of the tempest. The kitchen
has been removed into the house, no one is seen on the
courtyard, and there is a cracking and whistling among the
poplars. Now and then are heard the bells of a courier&rsquo;s
horse which canters by the outer wall, and perhaps brings
new instructions regarding me. Ma makes no sign, Lobsang
Tsering has disappeared, and Tsaktserkan comes only
when I send to ask him. We are more and more isolated,
no one dares associate with us. Our position is exciting
and even interesting. It is evident that we must leave
Shigatse, but by which route? I have already told them
that I will not go through Gyangtse or Khatmandu (capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
of Nepal), as Ma proposed to me, and to equip here a
caravan for the Chang-tang is out of the question. I have
only one goal, the north of the Tsangpo, where most important
discoveries await me. At the moment we are on
the point of leaving Shigatse we find ourselves for the first
time actually prisoners; as long as we remain here we
have at any rate freedom within our own walls. And as
long as I am in Tibet, I am <i>tabu</i> to the English, but as
soon as I cross the British frontier I am done for. I cannot
go to Eastern Turkestan, for the Chinese Government
has, as I hear from Gaw, cancelled my passport, because it
has been used for another country. To travel direct to
China with Ladakis will also not do. But if I am compelled
to make for Sikkim, I must dismiss the Ladakis
and travel alone to Pekin to explain the affair to the
mandarins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On March 15 the two gentlemen from Lhasa came to
me again. They had been to Gyangtse, and had received
orders from Gaw to watch all my movements carefully.
Again they wished to know the day of my departure, and
I replied that I could come to no decision until I knew by
what road I should travel. If it were to the Chang-tang,
they might count on a long delay, and might meanwhile
buy a house and marry at their leisure. They now complained
themselves of the increased power of the Chinese
in Tibet, and gave their opinion that only the unrest
arising from the new strict régime in Lhasa had rendered
it possible for me to travel across Tibet unnoticed.</p>

<p>In this they were probably quite right. The blunder
of the Dalai Lama and the unexpected change of front on
the part of the English had given the Chinese an opportunity
of establishing their supremacy over Tibet more
securely than they had been able to do since the days of
Kang Hi and Kien Lung in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. Of the prestige of England I could not perceive
a shadow, and I heard that the Tashi Lama regretted his
journey to India. Perhaps it was prudent of the Liberal
Government in London to give up Chumbi, and by barring
the frontier to exclude all possibility of boundary disputes
and friction on the Indian side; for in our times the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
Asia is beginning to waken out of its deep sleep, and the
Great Powers of Europe which have interests there
should rather seek to retain what they already possess
than endeavour to make fresh acquisitions. At any rate
the Chinese statesmen exhibited on this occasion admirable
prudence and vigilance, and gathered in all that the English
gave up. If ever the Dalai Lama returns safely to
Lhasa, he must content himself with the reverence accorded
to him in the Potala as an incarnation, and he will not be
allowed to have anything further to do with political affairs.
The country of Tibet will doubtless in the future be
closed as strictly as hitherto; for the supremacy over Tibet
is a political question of the first importance to China,
not only because Tibet is, as it were, a huge fortress with
ramparts, walls, and ditches protecting China, but also on
account of the great spiritual influence which the two popes
exercise over all Mongolians. As long as China has
the Dalai Lama in its power, it can keep the Mongols in
check, while in other circumstances the Dalai Lama could
stir them up to insurrection against China. And Mongolia
is also the buffer state between China and Russia.</p>

<p>On March 19 our prospects grew bright at last. Ma
had had a meeting with the two Lhasa gentlemen and the
authorities of the Shigatse Dzong. The last came to me
and begged me to inform them whither I meant to travel.
I answered: &ldquo;Along the Raga-tsangpo to its source.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentlemen who had held the meeting, had meanwhile
apparently come to the decision of taking the responsibility
on themselves of the consequences of my
journey to the west. But they firmly insisted that I
must take exactly the same route back to Yeshung by
which I had come, that is, through Tanak and Rungma,
or they would get into trouble.</p>

<p>When it was thus settled that we were not to go to
Gyangtse, I sent Muhamed Isa to Major O&rsquo;Connor with
all the maps, drawings, and the results hitherto acquired;
the whole despatch afterwards reached Colonel Dunlop
Smith in Calcutta in good condition. We had 3000 rupees
more in gold exchanged for silver money, and I wrote a
letter of farewell to my good friend O&rsquo;Connor, and likewise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
to my numerous friends in India. I also wrote home,
as usual, in the form of a complete journal.</p>

<p>On the 20th Ma came through our gate, triumphantly
waving a letter with a large red seal, and called out from
a distance: &ldquo;From the Tang Darin.&rdquo; The letter was
dated on March 15 at Lhasa, and I reproduce it here as
a specimen of Chinese diplomatic correspondence:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2"><span class="sc">Dear Dr. Sven Hedin</span>&mdash;I was much pleased to receive your
letter of the 5th instant, and to hear that you are come to Shigatse
in order to investigate the geography of the unknown parts of this
country. I know that you are one of the famous geographers of
Europe, that you move about here without meddling in the affairs
of Tibet, political or otherwise, and carry out only geographical work.</p>

<p>I have a great respect for you as a man of science, who seriously
advances the progress of earth knowledge. I always value such
men most highly and show them the greatest reverence.</p>

<p>But, to my great regret, I must inform you that the last treaty
between China and Great Britain contains a paragraph declaring
that no stranger, whether he be an Englishman or Russian, an
American or European, has any right to visit Tibet, the three
market-towns, Gyangtse, Yatung, and Gartok, excepted. You
are, then, not the only one to whom the country is closed.</p>

<p>I shall be glad, then, if you will return the same way you came,
and you will thereby put me under a very great obligation.</p>

<p>China and Sweden are really friendly Powers, and both peoples
are true brothers.</p>

<p>I hope you will not judge me harshly, for I am bound by the
treaty not to suffer you to travel further.</p>

<p>I have issued orders to the Chinese and native authorities along
your route to afford you all the facilities in their power.</p>

<p>Wishing you a successful journey, I am, yours truly,</p>

<p class="mr"><span class="sc">Chang Yin Tang</span>.&emsp;</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2">The letter leaves nothing to be desired as far as obliging
amiability is concerned, but its contents are diplomatically
obscure. Chinese and native authorities in the Chang-tang,
where we had not seen a living soul for eighty-one consecutive
days! Like Gaw, he falls back on the treaty
signed by Great Britain to close the most interesting
country in the world to exploration.</p>

<p>Ma knew the contents of the letter, and asked if it
were still my determination to follow the Raga-tsangpo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
upwards. If so, the route was open to me. I answered
in the affirmative, without showing any sign of my satisfaction,
for this road was not sanctioned by Tang&rsquo;s letter.
Now some of the gentlemen of the Dzong had to look after
the procuring of provisions&mdash;all by Tang&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the authorities of Shigatse became very
polite, and showered down visits on me, after they found
that I was in the good books of the most powerful man in
Tibet in temporal affairs. Six sacks of <i>tsamba</i>, a sack of
rice, and twelve cubes of brick tea were brought to my
courtyard, and exact information was asked for as to the
points I intended to touch on beyond the mouth of the
Raga-tsangpo. However, I did not satisfy them, but said
that not a single name up there was known to me. I
thought to myself that it was most prudent not to excite
suspicion by too many details; the farther we got away
from the central authorities the greater prospect we had of
being left alone. They inquired how many horses we
wanted, and I at once said 65, so as to be well provided;
they went away very quietly, as though they thought that
this was a very large number.</p>

<p>On March 24 Muhamed Isa came back with the silver
money, more letters, and all kinds of articles which Major
O&rsquo;Connor, with his usual kindness, had procured for me. In
the afternoon a great council was held: Ma, the two Lhasa
gentlemen, the whole Shigatse Dzong, and Tsaktserkan&mdash;in
all, nearly 20 officials, about 100 servants, Chinese
soldiers, and newsmongers; so that the whole court was
filled. The new passport was solemnly read to me. Therein
the places were mentioned through which I might pass:
the Raga-tsangpo, then Saka-dzong, Tradum, Tuksum,
Gartok, Demchok, and the Ladak frontier. I must not
stop at any point, must make long day&rsquo;s marches, and
travel straight along the valleys of the Brahmaputra and
the Indus. I considered it useless to make any objections
to the regulations; not a word was said of the country
north of the Tsangpo, where I suspected the existence of
the great mountain system. But I thought that we might
contrive ourselves in some way or other an excursion
thither, and resolved to give them plenty of trouble before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>
they got rid of me. Two Chinamen, an official of the
Labrang and one from the Shigatse Dzong, were to accompany
me for the first part of the journey, and then be
relieved by four others. The escort was introduced to me.
The gentlemen insisted that we should start next day, but
I declared that we required two days more to complete
our preparations. All the provisions they had hurriedly
collected were weighed in their presence, and paid for by
me.</p>

<p>The brown puppy arranged for the morning of the 25th
an interlude which certainly was not unexpected. Inspired
by uncivilized ideas about the sanctity of my tent, the bitch
had not ventured in for a long time, but now, just as I sat
writing my last letter, she came and scratched a hole with
her fore-paws in a corner of my tent, whined uneasily, laid
her head on my knee, and looked very unhappy, as though
she wished me to understand how helpless she felt. Before
I was aware two very small puppies lay squeaking at my
feet. While the young mother was licking her first-born
with great tenderness, Muhamed Isa made a soft lair for
the family. Puppy had scarcely taken her place on it when
two more puppies made their entrance into this queer world.
Then she probably thought that this was enough, for after
a good meal of meat and a bowl of milk she rolled herself
up with her well-tended young ones and went to sleep.
The new puppies were black as coal and small as rats. I
bought a basket for them to travel in until they could follow
on foot the caravan in which they were born, and become
good caravan dogs. We had tried here, too, in vain to get
some good dogs, for our vagabonds from the Ngangtse-tso
were good watch-dogs but unpleasant companions.
Now we had suddenly a whole pack, and it would be an
amusement to us to watch their development. Whatever
might be our future fate, we could not reach Ladak in less
than half a year, and by that time the puppies would have
grown big and comical. Henceforth Puppy was allowed
to live in my tent, and we became the best friends in the
world, for I was as anxious and careful about the young
ones as she. But she would not allow any one to approach
who had no business here; scarcely half an hour after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
catastrophe she dashed at two boys who were loitering
about the court. There was a dreadful whining in the
corner of the tent, but both the mother and young ones
were as well as could be expected under the circumstances,
as it is expressed in society bulletins.</p>

<p>In the meantime there was a very busy commotion in
our courtyard. The heavy baggage was packed; rice and
<i>tsamba</i> for the men, and barley for the horses, sewed up in
bags accurately weighed; Chinese macaroni, cabbages,
onions, fine wheaten flour, spices, potatoes, and as many
eggs as we could get, were brought in from the market.
The books, which I had received from O&rsquo;Connor, filled
a box to themselves, and would be thrown away, one after
another, as soon as they had been read. When all had
been packed up, my tent looked very bare.</p>

<p>On March 26, our last day in Shigatse, the packing
was finished and Ma Chi Fu, a young official in Chumbi,
came from Lhasa, bringing me greetings from Their Excellencies.
He was a Dungan (Mohammedan), spoke
gently and politely, and was one of the noblest, most
refined, and sympathetic Chinamen whom I have known.
He was also exceptionally handsome, had large bright
eyes, which had scarcely any characteristics of his race, and
pure Aryan features, and wore a valuable silken cloak. He
regretted that he had had no opportunity of showing me
hospitality, and begged me to believe that the escort would
be only a guard; it was only to watch over our safety, and
had orders to serve us to the best of its ability. Ma Chi
Fu brought a kind letter from Lien Darin, the Amban of
Lhasa, in which he wrote:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>I knew that you were a learned geographer from Sweden. I
am sorry that in consequence of the treaty I am not now able to
make better arrangements for you in Tibet, but you are a wise man,
and will therefore understand the difficulty in which I find myself
much against my will.</p>
</div>

<p>In all my personal contact and correspondence with the
Chinese they always showed me the greatest kindness and
consideration. They were the masters of the country, and
I had no right to travel about in Tibet, yet they never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
made use of hard words, much less of the means of actual
compulsion that were at their command, but carried their
hospitality as far as was consistent with loyalty to their own
country. Therefore I retain the most agreeable memories
of this and all my former travels.</p>

<p>In the evening I bade farewell to good old Ma, gave
him three useless horses, which would, however, recover
with good treatment, and thanked him for all his kindness
to me. He expressed a hope that we might meet
once more in this life. All who had been of service to
us received considerable presents of money, and Kung
Gushuk demanded 45 rupees as rent for his garden. I
would have gladly given him several times the sum for the
memorable days I had spent under the slender poplars,
when the soughing of the spring winds roused me out of
sleep.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">I was</span> awaked early on March 27. I mounted my horse,
accompanied by Robert, Muhamed Isa, and three men of
the escort, while the fourth had gone on with the caravan.
Muhamed Isa conveyed my hearty greetings to the Tashi
Lama, and my wishes that the course of his life might run
as smoothly and happily as heretofore. Meanwhile, I paid
a short return visit to Ma Chi Fu, and had not yet left him
when my excellent caravan leader returned with the kindest
greetings from the Tashi Lama and a large silken <i>kadakh</i>,
which I keep as a souvenir with the image he presented to
me. Then we rode in close order through the forbidden
streets for the last time, and the golden temple roofs disappeared
behind us. So, farewell for ever, grand, lovable,
divine Tashi Lama!</p>

<p>When we left the side valley of the Nyang-chu and
came out into the Tsangpo valley, we were exposed to the
storm coming from the west and covering all the country
with a thick cloud of dust. The long white foaming waves
of the river rose so high that the farther bank was invisible.
The horses were restless and would not go into the skin
boat, but at last we brought them all safely over. I now
rode a rather large brown horse which I had bought in
Shigatse. My small white Ladaki was still in good condition,
but he was exempt from work. Only three veterans
from Leh remained, two horses and a mule. Robert rode
one of the horses from the Ngangtse-tso, and Muhamed
Isa a large white horse from Shigatse, where we had also bought
two mules; the baggage was transported on hired horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
and asses. The caravan had encamped in the village of
Sadung on the north bank of the Tsangpo. Ishe had
carried the four puppies in his dress on his breast, and had
led Puppy with a string, that the young ones might be
suckled on the way.</p>

<p>Next morning we awoke in beautiful weather. Eastwards
were seen a series of brown mountain ridges with
shading growing lighter and lighter as they dipped to the
river, which stood out in still brighter colouring. The
dwellers on the bank here called the Brahmaputra Tamchok-kamba,
and said that it would fall for two months
more, and would then rise till it attained its maximum
at the end of July. Then it floods most of the valley
bottom, and rolls majestically down, while all around
assumes a fresher hue in the calm air of summer. At the
end of September the level of the water becomes lower,
and the river freezes only in cold winters.</p>

<p>We again retire from the holy districts, and ride
through villages standing at the mouths of side valleys,
past granitic promontories of the northern mountains, over
fields and dunes, and camp, as before, in the garden of the
Tashi Lama in Tanak. The four gentlemen that accompany
us have brought their servants with them, and
provide their own shelter, horses, and food. They have
received on setting out a certain sum for this purpose, but
for all that live at the expense of the villagers, eat and
lodge free of cost, and order fresh horses for every day&rsquo;s
march without paying any hire. They keep their travelling
money intact in their pockets, and are therefore well
pleased with their commission.</p>

<p>Both on the 28th and on the 29th, when we bivouacked
in Rungma, we had violent storms from noon onwards,
which blew in our faces. Nothing could be seen of the
surroundings, and frequently I could not perceive the man
just in front of me. We were pestered with sand, which
grated under our teeth, irritated our backs, and made our
eyes smart. Where the valley was contracted, the compressed
wind blew with double strength, and the sand-clouds
rolled in a greyish-yellow mass along the Brahmaputra
valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span></p>

<p>We went on the 30th on to Karu in brilliant weather,
still along the Tsangpo, which, green and free from ice,
gently lapped against the southern foot of the mountains.
Occasionally a boat glided downstream. The wild ducks
on the shore are very tame, for no one is allowed to kill
them, and, indeed, no one wishes to do so. Only a slight
local traffic is noticeable. We miss the pilgrims we saw on
the journey down; they are now at home again. We leave
on the right the small convent Chuding with its nine nuns.
On the steep mountain flanks are rocky paths used during
high water, for the road we follow is quite covered in
summer when the river is 5 feet higher.</p>

<p>In Karu wheat, barley, peas, and radishes are cultivated.
We had made a short march, and I had ample time
to interrogate the wise men of the village about the
geography of the country, the means of communication,
the climate, the habits of the river, and the directions of
the wind; but I have no room for such particulars in this
book. I would rather, instead, introduce our escort to the
reader. Vang Yi Tyn is a Dungan, born in Shigatse; Tso
Tin Pang has a Chinese father and a Tibetan mother, has
his home in Shigatse, holds the Lamaistic faith, and
murmurs prayers on the way; Lava Tashi and Shidar
Pintso are pure Tibetans. All four are friendly and ready
to help, and tell me in confidence that they mean to do
their very best, that I may be pleased with them and give
them good testimonials.</p>

<p>The last day of the month of March is marked in my
journal with an asterisk. While the caravan marched
straight towards Ye, the rest of us rode up a side valley,
at the mouth of which lies the village Tarting-choro,
surrounded by fields and willow trees. A small well-kept
<i>mani-ringmo</i> is covered with stones polished by
the river, in which the usual formula is not incised, but
another in red and blue characters, namely, &ldquo;Om mati
moyi sale do.&rdquo; The figure <img style="width:20px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img404a.jpg" alt="" /> is many times repeated,
and indicates a connection with the Pembo sect, while the
figure <img style="width:18px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img404b.jpg" alt="" /> is a mark of the orthodox yellow-caps.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">169. <span class="sc">The Little Brother of his Holiness with a Servant.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Farther up lies another village, having a <i>chhorten</i> with
a gilded turret in a copse of old trees. A red house is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
the <i>lhakang</i> (God&rsquo;s House) of Tarting-gompa, and behind
stands the house of the Grand Lama, picturesque and
unique, built in the usual cubical style, with white steps
and flat roof. Above it Tarting-gompa is throned on its
hill like Chimre or Tikze in Ladak (Illustrations 173, 174, 178).</p>

<p>We enter the court of the <i>lhakang</i> with its red walls;
on two sides a roof is supported by posts, a shed for the
riding horses, pack-mules, men and women who carry firewood
and goods&mdash;a cloister and a caravanserai at the same
time, where labour finds harbourage under the protection
of religion&mdash;and over it waves a long flag from a <i>tarchen</i>, a
mast standing in the midst of the court. The convent dog
is chained up. The gate has an unusually high threshold;
on the side walls of the entrance a tiger is painted in fresh
colours. We now enter the <i>lhakang</i>, and I must confess
that I started with surprise in the portal, for we had seen
many halls of the gods in Tashi-lunpo, but never yet one
so large, ancient and so wonderfully fascinating in its
mysterious light.</p>

<p>What rich and subdued colouring! The Sego-chummo-lhakang,
as it is called, is like a crypt, a fairy grotto, recalling
to mind the rock temples of Elephanta; but here all is
of red-painted wood, and 48 pillars support the roof. The
capitals are green and gold, carved in intricate and tasteful
designs, and carved lions, arabesques, and tendrils adorn
the projecting beams of the ceiling. The floor consists of
stone flags, their cracks filled up with the dust of centuries,
so that it is smooth and even as asphalt. The daylight
falls into the hall through a square impluvium, spanned by
a network of chains. There stands the throne of the
Tashi Lama, who visited the convent two years ago, and
is expected again in two years, and opposite is a pyramidal
stand, which is hung with lamps at certain festivals.
A lama sits all day long at a tall prayer-cylinder (<i>korlo</i> or
<i>mankor</i>) about 6 feet high, with a pile of loose leaves a
foot high in front of him, which he turns over rapidly, and
gabbles their contents so quickly that one wonders how his
tongue can move so fast. Frequently he beats a drum,
then he clashes cymbals, or turns the prayer-cylinder in
the heterodox direction (Illustrations 179, 254).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span></p>

<p>In another saloon, beside this, repose Grand Lamas of
the Pembo sect, high priests of Tarting-gompa. We find
here the same four-sided passage as round the sepulchres
of Tashi-lunpo. But as I was going, as usual, from right
to left, lamas hurried up to stop me. The monuments
are like <i>chhorten</i>, and are covered with gold plaques and
precious stones. Twelve statues of deceased high priests
have behind them huge gilded halos, richly carved with
carefully executed detail. Beside Shen Nime Kudun&rsquo;s
monument lie two black smoothly-polished round blocks,
apparently of porphyry or diabase. On one of them is
seen the impression of the foot of the above-named Grand
Lama. On the edge of the other are four impressions,
his four fingers, just as though the flat hand with the
fingers a little expanded had been pressed against a piece
of hard butter. One can try it with one&rsquo;s own hand; the
fingers fit in exactly, and the hollows are about 3/4 inch
deep. It is well and naturally executed&mdash;<i>pia fraus!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the monastery founded?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was so long ago that no one now living knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who founded it, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gunchen Ishe Loto, long before Tsong Kapa&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lamas spend all their lives in the convents, but
have no idea how old these are.</p>

<p>Then we ascend to the top of the hill, where several
convent buildings stand, and are received by a whole pack
of vicious dogs. The chief temple hall, Dokang-chummo,
is built on the same plan as the one below, and has
numerous images, some of which are covered with strips
and silver cases. We are led from one sanctuary to another,
and are astonished at the extremely finely-executed frescoes
that cover the walls. A temple in an elevated situation is
surrounded by an uncovered passage with balustrades and
prayer mills. A grand panorama of wild fissured mountains
extends all round.</p>

<p>We had heard that the evening before our arrival an
octogenarian lama had died, and I begged to be allowed to
see his cell. But the excuse was made that some monks
were reciting the prayers for the dead, and must not
be disturbed. However, the house of the deceased was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span>
pointed out to us, and we went and knocked at the door
of the courtyard. After a long wait a man came and
opened it. Half of the small court was occupied by a
black tent, where two men and a woman were cutting
chips of wood 2 feet long, on which prayers and holy
texts would be written, and then they would be used to
kindle the funeral pyre of the deceased. One was drawing
religious symbols and circles on a large paper, which
would also be burned. We mounted a short staircase
and came to a narrow open verandah before a store-shed
with leathern chests containing the clothing of the deceased,
and a compartment where his servant lived, who was now
engaged in printing prayers in red, on white paper, with a
wooden stamp; 700 such strips of paper are burned with
the body, and the prayers follow the soul through the unknown
realms of space.</p>

<p>From here we reach his cell, which is little more than
double the size of my tent. There sit two old monks, with
their backs against the trellised window. Books containing
the prayers for the dead lie on a table before them.
Two others sit on the floor in the middle of the room. All
four must pray thrice twenty-four hours, day and night, for
the soul of the deceased. The cell has a pillar, and is full
of idols, holy vessels, banners, and books&mdash;a small museum.
I asked if I might buy any of the things, but was told that
they must all be handed over to the monastery.</p>

<p>The divan bed, partly draped with red hangings, stood
against the shorter wall, the head to the window. Here
sat the body, bent very much forward and with the legs
crossed, and the back to the light. It was dressed in
coloured garments with shoes on the feet, a thin <i>kadakh</i>
over the face, and a head-covering of red and blue stuff
somewhat like a crown. Before it on the bed stood a
stool with images, bowls, and two burning candles.</p>

<p>The body is not consumed in this dress. A white frock
is put on, and a square cloth is spread over the knees, on
which a large circle and other symbols are drawn. A crown
(<i>vangsha</i>) of paper is set on the head, a square brimless
hat, on which a button is fixed within eight broad teeth;
it resembles an imperial crown. Thus attired the body, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
a sitting position, is burned in the hollow of the valley
below the temple. A lama carries the ashes to Kang-rinpoche
(Kailas), where they are deposited in a holy
<i>chhorten</i>.</p>

<p>At the age of five years this Yundung Sulting was
consigned by his parents in the year 1832 to the care of
the confraternity of Tarting-gompa, and his convent name
was thenceforth Namgang Rinpoche. He, too, was an
incarnation, and stood in high repute for his holiness,
wisdom, and learning. On account of these merits he was
burned, while the other monks in Tarting are cut in pieces.
His sister and only relation, an old wrinkled woman, was
present. The watchers of the dead were just in the act of
eating their dinner, which was placed on a stool&mdash;cold dried
meat, <i>tsamba</i>, and <i>chang</i> (beer). They were shy and
astonished, had never seen a European, and did not
know whether they should answer my questions as I sat
by them on the floor and took notes. I noticed, however,
that they were less concerned for themselves than for the
deceased. Twenty-four hours out of the prescribed seventy-two
had passed when I came to interrupt the masses for
the dead, and to disturb the soul which was nearly set free.
But Namgang Rinpoche sat still, meditating over the endless
enigmatical perspective that the formula &ldquo;Om mati
moyi sale do&rdquo; opened out to him; and as long as I
remained in his cell, no awful wonders and signs were
seen.</p>

<p>For my part, I thought of the singular fate of the man
whose life had come to an end the day before. As a novice
he had left for ever in childhood the free existence among
the black tents and grazing herds, said farewell to the world
and its vanities, and was received into a community of monks,
of whom none now remained alive. He saw his elders die
one after another, the young ones grow up to manhood,
and new recruits come in. They wandered for a season
through the temple halls, lighted the candles, and filled
the water-bowls before the statues of the gods, and then
passed on to other scenes on the endless road to Nirvana.
Seventy-five years he had been an inmate of the monastery,
and had lived in the cell in which his body now lay. How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
many soles must he have worn out on the same stone floor!
For seventy-five years he had searched the holy scriptures
and had pondered over an easier existence beyond the
funeral pyre; for seventy-five years he had seen the westerly
storms driving the sand along the Brahmaputra valley.
Only yesterday, at the point of expiring, he had listened
to the sound of the temple bells, which, with their clappers
bound with large falcon&rsquo;s feathers, had rung in his passage
to the world beyond. And then with tottering steps he
had followed the uncertain track of the brethren who had
passed away before him.</p>

<p>Such a life seems hopelessly sad and gloomy. And yet
a man who will venture to shut himself day and night within
the walls of a dim convent must possess faith, conviction,
and patience, for it is a prison which he in the tumult of
his mind has chosen of his own free will. He has renounced
the world when he allows himself to be walled in
alive in the dark courts of Tarting; and when the smoke of
his pyre ascends, it must, if equal justice be meted out to
all, be a pleasant savour before the eternal throne.</p>

<p>But evening was coming on, and we must set out again.
Below in a field a woman was ploughing with two oxen.
She was singing loudly and cheerily to lighten her work.
We rode on between low mountains, leaving Tanka-gompa
on our left. When we came down to the plain the darkness
was impenetrable, being made denser by thick clouds. A
violent north wind arose, bringing cold air from the Chang-tang.
At length we caught sight of comet tails of shooting
sparks&mdash;our camp-fire in the Ye, where we had halted for
a night&rsquo;s rest two months before.</p>

<p>We remained two days in the Ye or Yeshung, and here
took some liberties which were not in accordance with the
terms of our passport, but the escort made no protest. On
the first day we rode to Tugden-gompa, a row of cubical,
two-storeyed houses painted dark greyish-blue with vertical
white and red stripes. The monastery is said to be of the
same colour as the famous Sekiya, south-west of Tashi-lunpo,
and also belongs to the sect which allows lamas to
marry under certain conditions. The convent has thirty
monks, and is directly under the Labrang (Tashi-lunpo).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>410</span>
I will not enter into a full description, but will only say
that the <i>tsokang</i>, the assembly saloon and reading-room of
the lamas, had four red pillars, divans in the nave, and
handsome banners on the walls of the side aisles, which
were painted on Chinese silk, some with dragons on the
lower border, some without. The statues for the most part
represent monks of high rank (Lama-kunchuk, <i>i.e.</i> divine
lamas or incarnations). Before the portal stands a huge
bundle of rods with streamers in all the colours of the
rainbow, which are already torn by the wind. In an upper
hall is enthroned a figure of Hlobun-Lama, a regular bishop,
with mitre, cassock, and crozier. Some of these statues are
very comical&mdash;fat, jolly old boys with a divinely gentle
smile on their rosy lips, wide-opened eyes, and chubby
cheeks, sometimes with moustaches and imperials. The
likeness is probably more than doubtful, but at any rate
they are very unlike one another. Most of them are
wrapped in silken mantles. The Labrang here was closed,
for the head lama of Tugden was gone to the tent of a
dying nomad to the north. We visited a monk&rsquo;s cell
instead. It had a yard, a stall for the monk&rsquo;s horse, a
small dark closet for a kitchen, where a cat kept company
with two pots, and a large lumber-room crammed with
clothes, rags, images of Buddha, books, and tools, in which
a novice, the pupil of the monk, lodged.</p>

<p>Immediately to the south-east of Tugden a small poor
nunnery, Ganden-chöding, lies buried among hills. The
<i>dukang</i>, a dark crypt with red pillars and neatly carved
capitals, is reached through an unpretending portal in the
middle of the façade. Beggarly offerings, scraps of iron
and other rubbish, are hung on nails driven into the
pillars. The <i>serku-lhakang</i>, the holy of holies, receives
its light from the larger hall, and as this is dark, it must
be pitch dark in the inner shrine. The statues of Chenresi
(Avalokiteswara) and of the Tsepagmed (Amitayus) can
only be seen with a lamp.</p>

<p>The sixteen nuns of the convent are under the control
of Tashi-lunpo, and the Tashi Lama provides them with
tea once a day; the rest of their food they must beg in the
houses and tents, so that some of them are always on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
road. Now there were only five sisters at home, all dirty,
with short hair, and poorly clad. Two were young and
shy, the others were old wrinkled women with silvery-grey
bristles, and in clothes which had been red once, but were
now black with dirt, partly soot from the kitchen&mdash;a miserable
hole, where they spend most of the day. I asked them
whether they had attended the festival in Tashi-lunpo, but
they replied that their means would not allow them except
when a charitable person gave them travelling money. I
always left a few rupees in the convents I visited, and the
inmates were never too holy to take the valuable metal
from the hands of an unbeliever.</p>

<p>The whole broad valley at Ye is begirt by a circle of
monasteries. Our Chinamen had given notice of my visit
on April 2 to Tashi-gembe, a large convent of 200 monks,
who belong to the same colour as the monks of Tashi-lunpo.
We had an hour&rsquo;s ride to this town of white
sanctuaries, which are erected at the foot of a mountain
spur. About 100 brethren gave me a civil greeting at the
entrance, and led me to the paved court of ceremonies,
which has the same appearance as the one in Tashi-lunpo,
is surrounded by pillared galleries, has numerous pictures
of Buddha painted in fresco on the walls, and a throne for
the Tashi Lama, who celebrates a mass here once a year.
By a staircase of wood and stone, between two pillars of
the entrance hall, where the four spiritual kings keep watch
on the walls, we enter into a <i>dukang</i>, with the usual pillars
and divans. On two of these pillars hang complete suits
of armour with shirts of mail, casques and tasses of iron
scales fastened together with iron rings, maces, spears,
tridents, and lances; on one of these lances hangs a white
pennant with a brown border; on the pennant are
written characters, and on the point of the lance a skull
is placed. Among the harness <i>tankas</i> are suspended,
which, surrounded by silken cloths, look like escutcheons.
Amid this harness and weapons, which are worn by divine
powers when contending with devils, one may fancy oneself
suddenly transplanted into an ancient Asiatic castle.</p>

<p>A gallery runs round three sides, and standards and
banners hang down from it, all in fresh colours, tasteful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
handsome. In the middle of the altar rank is enthroned
Sakya-tubpa, the Buddha, and before the statues stands a
row of polished brass bowls with lights which, mingling
with the daylight, cast a magic gleam over the dusky hall.
Some are filled with crystal-clear water, the nectar of the
gods.</p>

<p>On one of the longer sides the folios of the Kanjur, the
collection of canonical books contained in 108 volumes,
as many as the beads in a rosary, are arranged in pigeon-holes.
The Tanjur, the other collection, consists of 235
folios&mdash;a caravan of about 150 horses would be necessary
to carry the two bibles of the Tibetans. Only rich monasteries
are able to keep both. The thought that no one
but themselves has waded through these endless scriptures
must inspire a feeling of security in the monks. A layman
is unable to confound a monk; he has never had an
opportunity of dipping deeply into these everlasting truths.</p>

<p>Above the idols and the altar runs a frieze of small
Buddha images forming, perhaps unintentionally, a highly
decorative element of the internal architecture of the hall.</p>

<p>Beside it lies the Kasang-lhakang, a temple with sixteen
pillars and a statue of the Sakya-tubpa. The hall is well
lighted with skylights, and abounds in gold and valuables,
climbing flowers, sacred trees, and lacquered shrines
inlaid with gold. Here, too, are holy writings with
unusually elegant margins; an embroidered silk cover is
laid over each volume. A copper gong is sounded whenever
fresh water is poured into the votive bowls.</p>

<p>The Tsokang is a more elevated hall, which is draped
with black hangings striped white at the bottom.</p>

<p>Monks were sitting in a small open space with a
quantity of small articles before them; it was an auction,
at which the worldly goods of a departed brother were
being sold. I acquired some wooden blocks with which
the holy scriptures are printed by hand.</p>

<p>In the Ganden-lhakang we see two <i>chhortens</i> of gold
and precious stones. In one of them are preserved relics
of a Grand Lama, some of his blood, his bones, and his
intestines. In a room situated beside this hall we saw
with surprise six curious figures of cast iron, representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
Europeans in the dress of the thirties of the nineteenth
century, with tall chimney-pot hats, stiff folded neck-cloths,
upstanding collars, and dress coats with high collars,
whiskers, and moustaches. They had come from Pekin,
and were quite out of place here before the tasteful group
of Buddhas, which was set up in a red lacquered niche,
where climbing plants, dragons, and small figures like
Cupids or angels were beautifully carved.</p>

<p>The Mankang-lhakang has figures of the higher gods
on the walls, and in the middle a prayer cylinder rises from
the floor up to the ceiling, 11½ feet high, and of such
circumference that I laid my outstretched arms four times
round it, measuring from finger-tips to finger-tips. Its red
surface is covered with gigantic golden characters, and
round the middle of the cylinder dances a string of
goddesses. A smaller hall of the same kind is called
Mankang-chang. On the upper edge of its prayer cylinder
is a peg which, as the cylinder revolves, strikes against the
clapper of a bell. An old lama sat before it and kept
the cylinder in constant motion by means of a string
attached to a crank on the iron axle. It is the duty of
himself and another monk to keep this monstrosity
humming all the day and half the night, or from sunrise
to midnight. As he sat turning, he said his prayers, but he
did not murmur them in the usual way. No, he bellowed,
he howled out inarticulate sounds, so that he foamed at the
mouth, perspired, and groaned, throwing himself violently
back at each revolution, and then bending forward again.
He was, so I was told, in a religious ecstasy, and did not
hear, however loudly one shouted to him. I should prefer
the oar of a galley slave to this monster, which cripples any
capacity of thinking freely in the darkness of the crypt,
where only musty dumb gods can be witnesses of its
rotations. I looked at my watch; the bell sounded nine
times in a minute, so that the machine makes 10,000
revolutions before the midnight hour comes to release the
weary monk.</p>

<p>We passed the whole day in the wonderful monastery
Tashi-gembe, which, after Tashi-lunpo, is the richest and
finest I have seen in Tibet. As to cleanliness and good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
taste, it surpasses all. The temple halls were well lighted
by numerous windows, the mid-day sun shone in between
the pillars and produced a bewitching play of light and
shade, and revealed a charming arrangement of colours
between red and gold. Some monks sat on a divan and
conversed with our companions; they made a clear and
effective picture in the sunlight, red on a red background.
Others leaned against the pillars, solemn as Roman
senators in their togas, in a flood of sunshine, while a
dense group of their brethren was dimly seen under the
shadows of the gallery. And where the sunbeams played
on the gold of Buddha&rsquo;s robe and broke on the leaves of
the golden lotus-flower, out of which he rises, reflexions
were scattered through the fairy hall, and the pillars shone
like transparent rubies. We were dazzled by these effects
of light, and might have been transplanted to the halls of
the gnomes.</p>

<p>In contrast to all this wealth, an old blind man of eighty
sat at a street-corner with a staff in each hand, and sang a
beggar&rsquo;s ditty. Beside him lay a half-starved dog, his only
friend in this world. The pitying love of Sakya-muni did
not extend so far as to release this old man from the bonds
of age and suffering. He also found a place in the picture
gallery of my sketch-book, which on this memorable day
received considerable additions. As ever, I felt myself to
be only a passing pilgrim, a wanderer who had crossed the
threshold of Tashi-gembe for a few hours, and a stranger
and guest in the dreary valleys of Tibet and its mysterious
enchanting temples.</p>

<p>The sun had set when we rode home, but the crests of
the eastern mountains still glowed as in a rain of transparent
gold. In the gently rippling water-channels the
wild-geese gathered, screaming, for their spring migration,
and the shadows of evening fell over the wide fields of
Yeshung.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE RAGA-TSANGPO AND THE MY-CHU</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">On</span> April 3 we journeyed steadily along the way to the
west by smiling villages and small convents, and again we
approached the bank of the Tsangpo, at a place where a
swaying rope-bridge is stretched between two loose blocks
on the banks. Here the river forms rapids, and above
this point it is only 50 yards broad, often still less, and the
valley above the Yeshung expansion is narrow and confined.
From the village Pusum, where we encamp, is seen
the mountain Nayala, one of the fixed points in Ryder&rsquo;s
triangulation. His and Rawling&rsquo;s expedition travelled to
the south of the Tsangpo, and it would be two months
more before I should first come in contact with their route.
The river will rise a month longer in consequence of the
melting of ice in the higher parts of its course in the
distant west.</p>

<p>The village Pusum lies on a steep terrace above the
river. Cones of detritus descend to the bank, and steep
mountains rise on the southern side. The valley is
narrow and quite straight, so that Pinsoling, the end of
the next day&rsquo;s march, can be seen from Pusum; it is
perched on its rocky promontory like a castle on the Rhine.
The path passes over steep disagreeable slopes of pebbles.
Only grey and red granite, with black schist, is seen both
in the solid rock and in the débris.</p>

<p>Almost immediately south of Chagha, a village of
a couple of stone houses in a grove of old willows, the
monastery and dzong of Pinzoling appear on the right
bank. The river is narrow, and the bank full of round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
granite boulders a yard in diameter, so the necessary
material for a bridge is at hand. Two huge pyramids
of stone are erected on the banks, and two smaller ones
behind them. Two thick chains are stretched between
them, which pass on to the smaller pyramids, and are made
fast again to them. Between the chains a network of
ropes is stretched like a hammock, and on this narrow
planks are laid; on these passengers walk, using the chains
as hand-rails. The Pinzoling bridge has not been used for
three years; any one who wants to cross to Pinzoling from
Chagha must go upstream to Ladse-dzong and make use
of the ferry there. I inquired how old the bridge was.
&ldquo;As old as the monastery,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;And how
old is the monastery?&rdquo; A villager answered at random,
&ldquo;A thousand years.&rdquo; Another said that this was an
exaggeration, for the monastery had been founded two
hundred and fifty years ago by a lama named Yitsyn Tara
Nara. Two hundred monks belong to the monastery
of Pinzoling, but half of them had gone on their travels.
An official of the dzong, with the title of Dsabo, lived in
Chagha, and examined our passport (Illustration 180).</p>

<p>The river was at its lowest level, but during high-water
it is said to come up to the chains of the bridge, which
seems to me improbable, for they hang fully 6 feet above
the surface of the water at their lowest part. A channel
remains open in the middle of the river even in cold
winters. Boats reach the side valley in which Shigatse
lies in four to five days, but during the summer in two or
three days, for then the river flows down with tremendous
velocity. It is considered less dangerous to travel in a
high flood, for then the boats glide smoothly over boulders
and sandbanks, and it is said that a man is very seldom
drowned, or a boat&rsquo;s cargo lost.</p>

<p>Black and dark-purple mountains rise around the village,
their surface only visible in some places in strips between
belts of drift-sand; they are like tiger skins. Near a ridge
to the south-west lies a large dune as though it were
attached to it.</p>

<p>The order of the day for April 5 was that Muhamed
Isa with the hired animals and the baggage should encamp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
at the point where the Raga-tsangpo flows into the upper
Brahmaputra. The rest of us rode up to a small pass,
Tsukchung-chang, on a spur of the mountains which extends
to the bank of the main river. From the summit
there is a grand view over the main valley and its stream,
which meanders over gravel and sand in two arms. Below
we caught sight of mule caravans, mere specks, but their
bells filled the valley with their noise. The way runs
headlong down to the valley bottom so that we had to
engage extra men to carry the baggage, with which the
horses could not clamber down the precipitous slopes.
Large dark fish swam in a stopped-up arm of the river,
and here sat Shukkur Ali with his rod. Sand-dunes ten
feet high are a common occurrence, and on the steep side,
turned from the wind, that is, the east side, pools are often
formed.</p>

<p>To the south-west opens a large portal with shelving
mountains in the background and short side valleys, the
whole forming a beautiful scene. Through this portal the
Brahmaputra comes down towards the Raga-tsangpo, but
this river is known here in its lowest course by the name
Dok-chu, while the main river is known as the Dam-chu
(= Tamchok). At the confluence no tents were to be seen,
and Muhamed Isa told me afterwards that he could not
stay there as the country was quite barren. We therefore
rode up the Dok-chu valley to the village Tangna, consisting
of ten stone houses. The inhabitants cultivate
peas, wheat, and barley, but cannot count with certainty
on a harvest.</p>

<p>I would on no account miss seeing the confluence of
the two rivers, and therefore ordered my men to descend
the Dok-chu valley next day to this point. But the escort
would not hear of it. It was clearly stipulated in the passport
that we must not go backwards and forwards as we
liked, but must march straight to Ladak. At last they
yielded under the condition that the excursion should not
last more than one day.</p>

<p>In the morning Muhamed Isa took the boat and the
oars down to the river, while ropes, stakes, axes, poles, and
provisions were carried by Ladakis down to the confluence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span>
by the way we had come the day before. On arriving at
the bank I found the boat already put together, and took
my seat in it with a Tibetan who was familiar with the
river and handled the oars as skilfully as though he had
done nothing else all his life, but he was accustomed to steer
his own boat between the banks at Tangna, and knew the
channel downstream.</p>

<p>Our voyage through the rapids is exciting and
adventurous. The fall of the river is by no means
uniform, but changes from place to place, roaring rapids
alternating with deep quiet basins. Large and small
boulders have fallen into the river from the mountain
flanks and sometimes it seems impossible to get through
them. But the oarsman knows how to steer the boat.
We hear the roar of the next rapid from a distance, and
keep a sharp look-out in front. Some of our Ladakis run
along the path on the bank and warn us of serious dangers.</p>

<p>The boat rushes flying downstream. The boatman
sits silent with his teeth clenched and his feet firmly
planted against the bottom, and grasps the oars so tightly
in his horny hands that the knuckles become white. We
had passed successfully several rapids and were gliding
pleasantly over a reach of smooth water, when we heard
the warning roar of the next rapids, this time louder than
ever, and two Ladakis stood shouting and gesticulating.
I got up in the boat and saw that the Dok-chu split into
two arms, and that the water dashed foaming among dark
sharp-edged boulders. The place looked impassable, the
intervals between the boulders seemed much too narrow
for the boat, which might any moment have its bottom
torn by treacherously hidden stones; over some of these
the water poured in bright-green hillocks, and then was
scattered into foaming spray. &ldquo;I shall be glad if all goes
well,&rdquo; I thought, but I left the boatman to his own devices.
We were soon in the sucking current, which endures no
resistance, and flew quicker and quicker towards the two
rapids. With powerful strokes the oarsman forced the
boat to enter the left branch. The Ladakis stood speechless
on the bank, and waited till we were wrecked to wade
into the rapids and rescue us. Now we dashed towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
the first block, but the boatman guided his boat into the
deepest water and let it slip down a small waterfall, after
which we received a thrust from the other side. Now the
channel became broader but also shallower, and we grazed
the bottom, fortunately only with the keel and without
springing a leak. The current was strong enough to carry
us away over stones and rubbish.</p>

<p>After a while the two arms re-unite and the river
becomes smooth and deep. The boatman has never
changed countenance, and now he helps on with the
oars. We are on the north side of the valley, and just
at the bend where the river turns southwards the water
rages and boils more furiously than ever, and here the
undaunted boatman declares that we can go no farther.
I hold my breath at the sight of the white foaming water
which breaks over the threshold of the fall; the boat will
be carried away in a second by the suction of the water
and will be infallibly capsized. But just at the right
moment the boatman steers our nutshell aside into a bay
with a back current, and we are able to land. The Ladakis
hurry up, draw the boat ashore, and set it afloat again
below the waterfall.</p>

<p>Now we float pleasantly past the steep rocky walls of
the southern bank, where the depth is sometimes 5 feet,
and sometimes less than a foot. I have a pole and help to
hold off the boat from the bank. Again we are carried to
the northern side of the valley and dance and rock through
a series of small lively rapids, usually quite deep enough.
Now and then we graze the bottom, but the wooden keel
resists the thumps. Below a gigantic boulder lying in the
middle of the stream is a sucking whirlpool, into which we
nearly stumble, but we get past safely, and at last arrive
at the point where the Dok-chu pours its snow-fed waters
into the flood of the Brahmaputra.</p>

<p>The tributary here forms a delta with two branches
between gravelly banks 5 feet high. A post was driven
in on the left bank of the main arm, to which we fastened
one end of a rope, with the other end I rowed over to the
right bank, where the rope was fastened to another post.
The breadth was 59 yards. Then I measured the depth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
at eleven points at equal distances apart, and found that it
did not exceed 3<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> feet. The velocity was measured on the
surface, half-way down, and at the bottom, with Lyth&rsquo;s
current meter. Taking the breadth and the average
velocity we arrive at the discharge, which in the two arms
of the Dok-chu amounted to 1165 cubic feet per second.</p>

<p>Where the two streams unite the Dok-chu is rapid and
tumultuous, the Brahmaputra slow, deep, and quiet. Its
breadth was 50 yards and its maximum depth 15.3 feet;
the bed is therefore narrow and very deeply excavated.
The discharge amounted to 2966 feet in the second, or
two and a half times that of its tributary the Dok-chu.</p>

<p>When I had finished this work, our friends Tso Ting
Pang and Lava Tashi accompanied me on a short excursion
down the main stream, and then we landed on a promontory
where our men lighted a fire and served up the
best provisions we had, namely, hard-boiled eggs, slices of
cold chicken, and milk. A cordial and mixed party, a
Swede among Tibetans, Chinamen and Ladakis, we
partook of our late dinner amidst the grandest, and
most boldly sculptured landscape conceivable. While
the others smoked their pipes and sipped their greasy tea,
I drew a sketch of the mighty gate of solid granite through
which the Brahmaputra rolls its volumes of water on its
way to the east, to the valley of the Dihong and the plains
of Assam. We should have liked to stay here longer,
watching how moment after moment the insatiable stream
gathers in its abundant tribute from the Dok-chu, but it
was growing dark and we had a long way to go back, so
we packed up our boat and stowed it on hired horses with
the other baggage, mounted into the saddle, and rode up
the valley. As had often happened before, we were to-day
overtaken by the darkness. Rabsang went in front with a
Tibetan on either side, and all three bellowed as loud as
they could. All were in excellent spirits, it was so fresh and
pleasant under the twinkling stars, and the merry singers,
accompanied by the jingle of the bells on the Chinese
horses, awoke a shrill echo in the recesses of the mountains.
At a dangerous place near a village, where the
road runs above the river over a ledge built up of stones,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
men came to meet us with paper lanterns, and soon after
we sat resting in our tents after a hard but very instructive
day&rsquo;s work. Next day we marched gently up the Dok-chu
valley in a north-westerly direction, a charmingly beautiful
road, where one would like to dismount repeatedly to enjoy
conveniently the wild mountain scenery.</p>

<p>But now I cannot loiter; one page after another of my
journal must be turned over if I am ever to come to an
end of my description of this journey on which so many
hard experiences and disagreeable adventures awaited us.</p>

<p>We ride through rubbish and coarse sand, the weathering
products of the grey granite, and pass a succession of
transverse valleys and several picturesque villages. One
of these, Machung, is finely situated at the foot of steep
rocks on the northern side of the valley, from which an
oval block has fallen down and stands like a gigantic egg
in the sand, a pedestal waiting for an equestrian statue.
On its eastern side, smoothly polished by wind and
weather, a regular tricolour is painted, white in the middle,
red on the left and blue on the right, but neither Bonvalot
nor Dutreuil de Rhins has left this memorial behind, for
no traveller has ever been in the neighbourhood. It is
the inhabitants of the village who have made this flag, and
beside the tricolour is another symbolical painting, a white
cross on a black field. Near the village some gnarled
trees are reflected in a pool. The villagers stand staring
at the corners and in the house-doors, and a man offers my
servants a drink of <i>chang</i> from a wooden bowl. The rocks
are sculptured into singular forms; the granite is in
vertical dykes and stands in perpendicular crags in the
valley. We often pass by <i>mani</i> cists, for we are in a
country where monasteries are numerous and the whole
road is adorned with religious tokens. At every cist the
road divides, for no one, except adherents of the Pembo
sect, omits to pass it on the left, the direction in which the
prayer mills revolve. On the tops of many of the rocks
are seen ruins of walls and towers, a proof that the valley
in bygone times was more densely peopled. At two places
sheltered clefts in the rock harbour some stunted juniper
trees. On the northern side of the valley the river has at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
some time polished the base of the granite wall, and on
the smooth surface two rock drawings have been executed.
They consist of outlines of Buddha pictures, and are very
artistically drawn. The western has two others beside
it, now scarcely traceable, and below them all kinds of
ornamentation, tendrils, and designs are hewn in the
granite. We encamped just above this spot in a very
picturesque and interesting expansion of the valley at the
village Lingö.</p>

<p>Part of the inhabitants of Lingö migrate in summer with
their herds, six or seven days&rsquo; journey northwards, for the
soil round Lingö is very poor and the harvest cannot be
depended on. The Dok-chu cannot be crossed here in
summer except by boat; in the winter it freezes over, but
seldom so firmly that the ice will bear. The interesting
point about this expansion is that the Dok-chu, or Raga-tsangpo,
coming from the west, here unites with our old
friend the My-chu, which discharges 534 cubic feet a
second. I had the day before calculated 1165 feet as the
discharge of the Dok-chu, so the difference of 631 cubic
feet is the volume of water brought down by the Raga-tsangpo,
and consequently the My-chu is only a tributary.
On the other hand the Dok-chu pours through several
delta arms with rapids into the My-chu which lies lower
and flows more gently, and by this test the My-chu should
be the main river; it is all a question of choice.</p>

<p>We had another fine day on April 8, 52.5° in the
shade at one o&rsquo;clock. We were to make a closer acquaintance
with the My-chu, a river we had hitherto known only
from hearsay, but we had more knowledge of its eastern
tributaries which we had crossed on our journey south.
As usual we change our baggage horses in almost every
village at which we encamp, and Robert pays the hire to
the villagers, that the escort may not have an opportunity
of putting it into their own purses, at any rate not in our
presence. Generally the caravan marches a little in advance,
while two villagers come with me and give me information
about the country.</p>

<p>Immediately beyond Lingö we turn into the My-chu
valley, riding northwards, and now leave behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span>
westerly valley of the Raga-tsangpo. Right at the turn
we come to a colossal cone of round blocks of granite,
among which the path winds up and down in zigzags,
sometimes transformed to a staircase, which laden animals
cannot possibly pass. We therefore take with us some
peasants from the village to help in carrying the baggage.
We have the river on our left, deep and sluggish. The
fallen boulders of grey granite contrast strongly with the
dark-green water in which whole shoals of black-backed
fishes swim and rise. On a surface of granite is a
Buddhist rock-drawing half obliterated by time. Then
follows one <i>mani</i> after another. A smith is housed in a
cave with a vaulted roof blackened with soot, and sheltered
by a small screen of stones, and offers his services to
travellers. High up on a rocky terrace stands Gunda-tammo,
a small nunnery, and below a chain bridge between
two stunted pyramids spans the river. It is only
for foot passengers. The river bed is deeply excavated
between its bank terraces, and two strips of clear green ice
yet remain. The bed is as regular as a canal. On a
rocky wall at the entrance of a side valley a face 6 feet in
diameter is painted in black, with eyes, nose, and mouth
in red.</p>

<p>The farther we go up the more frequently we are
reminded that we are on a hallowed road leading from one
temple to another, a sacred way of the monks, a pilgrim
route on which &ldquo;Om mani padme hum&rdquo; is murmured more
repeatedly than on ordinary roads. Sometimes boulders
and cliffs are painted red, sometimes cairns are heaped
beside the way, now we see chimney-like monuments with
bundles of rods decked with streamers, then again long
<i>mani</i> mounds, one of them nearly 400 feet long. Two
blocks lying on the road are covered all over with raised
characters&mdash;a formidable piece of work. We are also in
a great commercial artery, more frequented than the bank
of the Tsangpo. We constantly meet caravans of yaks
and mules, mounted men and foot-passengers, monks,
peasants, and beggars. They salute me politely, scratching
their heads with their right hands, while they hold
their caps in their left, and putting their tongues far out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>424</span>
of their mouths, and they call out to me: &ldquo;A good
journey, Bombo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clear rivulets trickle across the road, the valley contracts
and its contours become bolder and more pronounced;
the granite ceases and is replaced by fine-grained
crystalline schist. In the district of Tong, where
several villages stand high above the river, we encamp below
the monastery Lun-ganden-gompa (Illustration 176), in which
21 monks of the Gelugpa sect live, and, as usual, a prior of
Kanpo rank dwells in the Labrang. We paid them a visit,
but preferred the lovely view over the valley to the images
of the gods in the darkness. The brethren are maintained
partly by the Tashi Lama, and obtain the rest of their
food from the produce of their fields, for the convent has
large glebe lands. A blind man, who was not of the
fraternity, sat like a machine at the prayer mill, turning it
for the monks, and complained of his hard lot. The Gova,
the district chief, of Tong rules over several villages in the
neighbourhood, and lives like a prince in his solid house.</p>

<p>On April 10 we continued along the course of the
My-chu, past villages and convents hitherto unknown.
The villages stand just below the mouths of side valleys
where the water can be most effectively applied to
irrigation. A caravan of about 100 yaks, driven by men
and women and some carrying riders, had been at Tok-jalung
and had sold there <i>tsamba</i> from Tong; they had
spent three months on their return from those gold-diggings
in western Tibet. They follow a route through
the mountains where there is suitable pasture for yaks.
Thus the produce of the soil in the more favoured parts
of the country reaches the nomads, who give in exchange
for it wool, hides, and salt. After a short march we
bivouacked in Ghe, which has nineteen houses. An <i>angdi</i>
(musician) scraped and plucked a two-stringed instrument
(Illustration 185), while his wife danced before us.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">185. <span class="sc">Strolling Musicians.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Here our escort from Shigatse turned back, after
handing our passport to four other men, the chief of whom
was the Gova of Tong. They had done us excellent
service, so I gave them good testimonials and presents.
They were satisfied and would pray for my prosperity till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span>
their lives&rsquo; end. I felt particular sympathy for one of the
Tibetans who had lost his two sons in the battle at Guru;
the one was twenty-three years old, and the other twenty-five,
and the father could not understand why they had
fallen, for they had done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Next day the escort, jingling like a sledge party,
accompanies us up the My-chu, which retains the same
character. Granite and schists alternate. The river
tosses about, though it has occasionally quiet reaches.
In the background of the side valleys are often seen great
mountains lightly covered with snow, and at their entrances
villages with stone houses and fields where only barley and
peas are grown, seldom wheat. The black tents we see
occasionally belong to merchants who are on their way
from or to western Tibet. Bridges cross the affluents,
flat slabs of stone on a pair of beams between rather high
slightly overhanging piers of stone. The religious stone
heaps are still numerous; one has caused a sand-dune to
be formed. Wild ducks, wood pigeons, and partridges
occur here, and the latter, sorely against their will, make
acquaintance with Tsering&rsquo;s kitchen. In the village Sir-chung
the population is large, for here several routes and
side valleys converge. Among the crowds of spectators
was a young woman so extraordinarily pretty that I took
two photographs of her. She was twenty years old and
was named Putön (Illustration 186).</p>

<p>The day following we visited the adjacent monastery
Lehlung-gompa, where the twenty-six monks belong to
some heterodox sect, for they recognize neither Tsong Kapa
nor the Tashi Lama; the prior had shut himself up in his
dwelling sunk in deep speculations. A lama and three
inhabitants of the neighbouring village Nesar had died
the day before, so our Tibetan escort warned us not to
go up to the monastery lest we should catch the infection,
and when we nevertheless went, they begged
to be allowed to stay behind. This dreary dilapidated
monastery stood proudly on its point of rock, pretty far
up a side valley which descends from the left to the
My-chu. From its flat roof we had a splendid view and
could make out the topography of the My-chu valley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
A novelty to us was a row of stuffed yaks, hard as wood
and dry as bone, with their horns, hoofs, and hides, hung
up on the ceiling of a verandah. None of the monks
could remember when they had been hung up. They
looked very old, and apparently were for the same purpose
as the four ghostly kings and the painted wild animals,
that is, to scare away evil spirits.</p>

<p>Below the monastery twenty-four <i>manis</i> stand close
together in a row like a parish boundary on a topographical
map. All the way up these sacred structures
are so numerous that they even outnumber those near
Leh. The country assumes a more alpine character, and
the valley becomes wilder and more desolate; but some
trees form a small thicket at Lehlung-gompa. At length
we ride over a pebble terrace, perhaps 130 feet above
the stream, which now pours over small falls and murmurs
pleasantly among boulders. The caravan has pitched its
tents in the narrow valley on the bank of the My-chu
and not far from the side valley Kathing. Most of the
luggage has been carried by Tibetans, for no pack animals
were to be had, and now some hundred black-headed
fellows sit in groups by their fires among the large
boulders.</p>

<p>Here we were at a height of 13,875 feet, and therefore had
only mounted up 1175 feet from Shigatse (12,700 feet). But
the air was cooler; the night before we had noted 23 degrees
of frost.</p>

<p class="center chap2">TO LINGA-GOMPA</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> day&rsquo;s march on April 13 takes us along the valley of
the My-chu like a hollow way excavated in the solid rock
of fine-grained granite, porphyry and crystalline schist,
and the landscape is one of the grandest I have ever
seen. We follow the western bank, from which rise wild
precipitous rocks like the ruins of old walls and embattled
forts. A footpath runs along the left bank also, and looks
extremely dangerous, passing up above abrupt walls of
rock. Here and there valleys open out on the west side,
affording views of part of a snow-covered crest in the background.
This is, however, a subsidiary range, for it
branches off from the Trans-Himalaya southwards and
borders the basin of the My-chu on the west. It in turn
sends out ramifications eastwards, between which flow
the western tributaries of the My-chu. And these again
give out branches of the fourth and fifth order; the
whole appears in a plan like a tree with its branches and
boughs.</p>

<p>The road runs on steep pebble terraces high above
the river, which here rages among the boulders in its
deeply eroded bed and forms whirlpools. On our left
rocky precipices tower above our heads, and avalanches
of detritus have slipped down from them and fallen across
the road. Many are quite fresh; in other places there
has been time to set up the blocks in protecting walls on
the inner side and in a breastwork at the outer. And
often we pass places where a new landslip may take place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
at any moment, and where huge blocks are poised in the
air and seem ready to roll down the declivity. Flourishing
hawthorns in large numbers grow on the stony banks, and
high up above rock pigeons have built their nests. Still
higher eagles soar with outspread pinions along the
mountain flanks. We are 150 feet above the river, where
here and there on the bank is room for small tilled fields;
a juniper bush has in some places struck root in a fissure
of the rock.</p>

<p>The valley is like a trough, and I obtain fine views of
constantly changing scenes. We might fancy we were
passing through a Gothic cathedral with a colonnade of
huge shafts attached to the walls and spanned by a roof of
grey and white canvas, the clouds to wit, between which
small patches of light blue cloth appear.</p>

<p>The guide, accompanying us on this day, is a half
silly old fellow, who laughs and chatters continuously,
and frequently begins to dance on the road, flinging his
legs about, stamping on the ground and turning round
so quickly that his long pigtail flies round him. He tells
us in confidence that his wife is a wicked hideous old
dragon, whom he has long wished to carry off to the
home of the vultures, for there will be no peace in his
house till he has done so. When I halt to sketch, he
takes his breakfast out of his coat, lays it out on the sand,
fetches water from the river in a small bag, shakes <i>tsamba</i>
from another into a wooden dish, pours water over it,
stirs it with his forefinger and then swallows bowl after
bowl of this delicious mixture. He hopes to receive so
much pay, that for once he can afford himself a plentiful
meal while his old woman cannot see him eat. As often
as one looks at him, out shoots his tongue and hangs like
a fiery red flag in the middle of his black face. When he
has finished he licks his plate clean and rubs it with sand to
dry it. Then he wraps his things up in a bundle and
hides it under the stones. When Robert tells him that
people are about who have seen him hiding it, he quickly
takes his bundle out again, thinks over the matter for a
while, rummages about and at last finds another hiding-place.
Then he sits down beside me, puts out his tongue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
as far as it will go, winks at me with his little pig&rsquo;s eyes
and takes a large pinch of snuff. When he walks in front
of my horse, he turns round every hundred paces and
puts his tongue out at me&mdash;a token of pure goodwill and
deep respect.</p>

<p>Beyond the nunnery Döle-gompa the valley of the
My-chu unites with the large side valley Lenjo running
in from the west, in which, farther up, three villages are
situated. From this valley the My-chu receives a very
considerable tributary, which is crossed by a solid bridge
of three arches resting on four stone piers; thick belts of
ice still lie along the banks. Here we find two fine
<i>manis</i> with turrets at both ends, where six-pointed stars
are cut into the flat stones. These perpetual <i>manis</i> often
stand in long rows so near together that they look like
a long luggage train, and one expects to see them move
and start off for the abodes of the blessed. Everything
here denotes a great highway, a mighty commercial artery
connecting the sedentary people of the lower-lying lands
with the nomads of the plateaus. The road itself is the
largest and best kept that I have seen in all Tibet.
Bridges span all the affluents which might interrupt the
traffic in summer and autumn, and wherever a landslip
has occurred, the road is repaired at once. Sacred cairns,
walls, and streamers indicate to the traveller at every
step that a monastery is near, where the monks expect a
visit and a present of money. We are always meeting
caravans, riders, peasants, and beggars who extort money
from merchants returning home after a good stroke of
business. Many of these beggars turn into robbers and
pillage undefended huts, but when they meet us they
begin to hobble, gasp, and whine. After the harvest the
traffic will be still more active than now.</p>

<p>The valley now contracts to a corridor, and the broad
shallow stream occupies all its bottom. On the right side,
which we follow, the cliffs of schist fall perpendicularly to
the river, and the dangerous, narrow road runs like a sill
along the wall of rock. Here nature has opposed endless
insurmountable obstacles to the engineering skill of the
Tibetans. The baggage has to be carried past these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>430</span>
dangerous places, and it is astonishing that the horses
can get past. Flat slabs of schist, branches, and roots
have been inserted into cracks and fissures of the precipice
120 feet above the river, and on these planks, poles, and
stones are laid forming a gutter a foot broad, without a
scrap of railing, where one must even keep one&rsquo;s tongue
in one&rsquo;s mouth lest one should lose one&rsquo;s balance. Of
course we traverse this stretch of road, called Tigu-tang,
on foot, leaning inwards and supporting ourselves by the
rock. We breathe freely again when we are safely over,
and the great basin lies before us where, at Linga, two
important valleys converge.</p>

<p>Here is the confluence of the My-chu with a river
flowing from the east, the Sha-chu, which farther up is
called Bup-chu, and which we crossed two and a half months
before on its thick coating of ice. On April 15 the Bup-chu
brought down 215 cubic feet of water and the My-chu
222, so the rivers were nearly equal, but the ratio may of
course vary considerably according to the distribution of
the precipitation.</p>

<p>In a short valley in the western mountains the monastery
Linga-gompa is placed on the uppermost ledge of
a steep flight of terraces, and is as fantastic, fascinating,
and attractive as a fairy castle. Its white houses are
perched like storks&rsquo; nests on mountain pinnacles; a row
of <i>manis</i> points out the way up to where the pious, blameless
saints dwell in deep silence, far above the riot and
tumult of the villages and the roaring and tossing of the
stream. Below the monastery stands the village Linga-kok,
where our camp is pitched not far from a bridge
of ten arches on eleven piers which crosses the My-chu.
A crowd of Tibetans, black as Moors, dirty, ragged,
capless and trouserless, watch our arrival in silent amazement
(Illustration 188).</p>

<p>Not a single tree is seen in the neighbourhood; only up
at the monastery there are two. This consolation, then, is
no more, and only in our memory do we hear the thick
foliage of tree-tops rustling in the wind. Again we may
expect the moaning of the storm on the passes of bare
alpine ranges. Moreover, the spring has not set in in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
earnest, for in the night there were still 30 degrees of
frost.</p>

<p>I spent all Sunday till twilight in the monastery, with
Rabsang and Tundup Sonam. We mounted the acclivity
past rows of well-kept <i>manis</i>, which had the appearance of
broken-down walls, with red-painted inscriptions chiselled
out of the blocks of schist and framed in red. Then we
passed through a gate in the convent wall, and mounted
higher and higher between forty old and more recent
white houses clinging to the rock. The situation is like
that of the Hemis monastery in Ladak, but there the
houses are not so scattered. Several of them are unoccupied,
for the custom prevails here that, when a lama
dies, his relations claim possession of his house, lock the
door and take away the key. His movable property
reverts to the convent. If a newly-come lama takes
a fancy to an empty house, he can buy it from the
heirs of the former owner; a good house is worth 100
rupees (Illustration 175).</p>

<p>Linga has thirty monks, some of whom accompanied us
on our rounds and were always pleasant and friendly, and
never bold like the monks in Kum-bum, which I visited in
the year 1896. The monastery is subordinate to Sekiya,
and the Sekiya-Lama is its highest spiritual superior and
contributes towards its maintenance. Linga-gompa also
possesses lands, which, however, have not yielded much of
late, for the crops have failed several years in succession.
The monks are not dependent on the Tashi Lama, and
have not a single statue of Tsong Kapa, whence it may be
concluded that their sect is older than the reformed church.
But it was, as usual, impossible to get any information
about the age of the monastery. It seems to be in the
interest of the monks to date back its origin to the
remotest antiquity, of which no human records are extant.
I was told, however, that the abbot, Yimba Tashi, knew
its age, which was recorded in an old chronicle of the
monastery. Unfortunately, he was not at home, having
gone northwards to a district called Kumna, there to track
out a band of robbers who had plundered him the year
before and carried off all his caravan animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span></p>

<p>Down below the convent is a gorge with a black slope
of schist on its side, on which the six holy characters are
exhibited in fragments of white quartz, and call out to
heaven the eternal truth, &ldquo;Om mani padme hum,&rdquo; in all
kinds of wind and weather.</p>

<p>A staircase of flags of schist leads up to the Dopcha, an
open platform paved with flagstones where the religious
spectacles take place on feast days. The usual flagmast
stands in the centre, but there is no breastwork of any kind,
so that one dares not go there after dark, for bottomless
abysses yawn round the open sides. Here the monks had
laid carpets and cushions and invited me to tea. I enjoyed
for a while the fine view over the valley, the confluence of
the two streams, the scattered villages, and the fields like
chessboards. Far to the east, behind the Bup-chu valley,
the lofty mountains are seen over which we travelled on
the way from the Ngangtse-tso.</p>

<p>On the south side of the square is the entrance to the
chief temple (<i>dukang</i>), which in all monasteries is in a red-painted
stone building. We enter, look round, and are
carried away by the singular mysteriousness, though we
have often seen it before with trifling variations. I sink
on a divan and fancy myself in a museum crammed full
of modern trophies and flags of victory, where impenetrable
darkness lurks among the pillars, and rows of drums,
gongs, prayer cylinders, and trombones are set up. The
hall is darker than usual, but bright light falls through a
skylight on to the images of the gods. They seem to
be soaring from their pedestals in the darkness into the
glorious light of the upper regions. The monks glide
inaudibly like ghosts and shadows among them, busied
with the votive bowls. A wonderfully weird scene! We
have wandered into a cavern where gnomes and hobgoblins
creep about.</p>

<p>This grotto resounds the whole time with the chant of
the monks on the divans, which rises and falls in rhythmical
waves, like the roar of the billows and the lapping of ripples
on a strand. They sing in unison, keeping faultless time
and without exerting themselves, though with astonishing
rapidity. Among them are greyheaded men with cracked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
voices, men in the prime of life, and youths and boys with
fresh young voices. The sound is like horses trotting
quickly over an endless wooden bridge; all the monks
clap their hands and then the horses seem to trot over a
paved street, but the next moment they are on the bridge
again and the consonants roll like peas out the monks&rsquo; lips.
Now and then a bass voice rises above the din calling out
&ldquo;<i>Laso, Laso</i>&rdquo; (an exclamation of thanksgiving). During a
short pause there is tea. Then the chant goes on again.
There is no excitement, no hurrying of the tempo, all
goes on in the same even quick trot. The monks have no
books before them; they know their liturgy by heart.
But the charm of the rhythm seems to render them
oblivious of time and space; they do not suffer themselves
to be disturbed, but trot on over the bridge that
leads to the home of the gods and to Nirvana. As we go
out again we hear the chant die away like the humming
in a bee-hive.</p>

<p>We visited some other halls, where I noted down the
names of the images. At length there remained only two
convent buildings on a sharp ridge of rock. The first was
named Chörigungkang, and had a sort of shed in which
swords, guns, drums, masks, tiger-skins, and other lumber
were stored. In the very front, on the point of the rock,
is a cubical house called Pesu. It is surrounded on three
sides by a gallery without balustrades, and here the abyss
is deeper than elsewhere. Here I stayed to sketch the
panorama, but the weather was anything but pleasant, and
snowstorms veiled the mountains from time to time.
Nevertheless it was hard to leave this terrace. The flat
roofs down below look no larger than postage-stamps.
Bright as silver, or dark, according as they are lighted,
the two rivers hasten to meet each other. Then I could
not help thinking how singular it was that the loftiest and
grandest alpine country in the world, which must surely
impress the human mind more than any other, had not
been able to instil into the Tibetans a higher, nobler form
of religion than this narrow, limited, dogmatic Lamaism.
I grant that it was imported from India more than a
thousand years ago and was first modified into the so-called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
northern Buddhism, but after all it flourishes
vigorously in Tibet. One would think that the ancient
Bon religion with its copious demonology, its widespread
superstition, and its spirits haunting all the mountains
and lakes, would be more suitable here. But we have
indeed, discovered that Lamaism has absorbed many of
its elements. At any rate the Linga monks have a
splendid view of an artistically sculptured corner of the
world. From their loopholes of windows and their flat
roofs they can see winter spreading its white carpet over
the mountains and putting the rivers in fetters, and then
the spring shedding its gold over the valleys, the summer
conjuring out new fresh grass, and lastly the rain torrents
of early autumn washing the slopes and swelling the
rivers.</p>

<p>We now ascended, as if the mountain itself were not
high enough, two steep pitch-dark flights of steps, where
it is easy to break one&rsquo;s neck, into the entrance hall of the
Pesu temple. In a smaller room the flame of a butter-lamp
struggled vainly with the darkness, casting its dull
light on some idols. Pesu is the hall of the gods <i>par
excellence</i>, with innumerable statuettes of metal, very old,
artistically worked and certainly very valuable. Some
figures were of medium size. I stood in front of the altar
rank and inspected the gods. <i>Tankas</i> and long narrow
scarves in many colours hung from the ceiling. On the
right was the small, dark room, and on the left was a
shutter creaking as it banged to and open in the wind.
Before the gods stood a row of bowls with barley, wheat,
maize cobs, and water. I asked a monk who had come up
with me how long it took the gods to eat it all. He smiled,
and answered evasively that the bowls must always be full;
but on entering I had caught sight of some mice which
quickly scuttled away in the darkness. What cruel irony,
what a picture of self-satisfied vanity and religious humbug!
The serving brother has been in the Pesu, has filled the
bowls and said his daily prayers, has descended the steps
and locked the door behind him. When all is quiet the
mice come out of their holes. They climb upon the altar
table, stand on their hind-legs, curl their tails round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
votive bowls, and consume the nectar and ambrosia of the
gods.</p>

<p>Could I not buy some of these charming figures? No,
it could not be. The monk showed me a label which is
attached with wire to each image. Every object belonging
to the furniture of the convent has its number, and this
number is entered in the general inventory. The prior is
usually elected for a fixed term of years, and when he
resigns his office he hands the list to his successor to be
checked. If any object is missing, he is responsible and
must pay the value.</p>

<p>A monk came up to bring tea for Rabsang and Tundup,
who had seated themselves in the outer hall. I remained
alone and gazed at the gods, mesmerized by their smiling
gilded faces, their portly double chins, and their arched
eyebrows. Then something wonderful happened. Their
features changed and all turned their heads and looked at
me. A curious feeling of awe took possession of me;
had I insulted them through some want of delicacy? No,
next moment they turned their heads away again and
stared straight at the opposite wall. It was only a banner
which in the draught from the window had moved so as to
alter the shadow on the faces and give them an appearance
of motion.</p>

<p>Linga is a ghostly castle, but Pesu was the most
ghostly part of it all. There large drums and grinning
masks shimmered like ghosts in the gloom, and the wind
whistled mournfully through all the loopholes and openings.
A man of strong nerves would get the horrors if he
were compelled to spend a stormy autumn night alone in
this hall of the gods, with the light of the moon falling
through the loopholes on the images. He would listen
with bated breath for every sound and crack. If the door
below banged against its frame, he would hear some one
entering the ante-chamber, and when the streamers on the
roof fluttered in the wind, he would imagine the unknown
person was approaching the hall with light steps and
would in a second be bending over him; and the mice
running over the floor, and the shutters swinging in the wind
on creaking hinges, and the wind moaning in the window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
recesses and among the rafters, all would strain his imagination
to the utmost and make him count the minutes
till the dawn. After the gods had turned their heads
towards me I felt that I should not like to be in such a
position, but would rather go down again to my tent in the
valley and sleep.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
